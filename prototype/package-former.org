;; Below “meta-variables” are quoted...?

XS must be a valid Lisp expression denoting a list; e.g.,
(list 1 2 3) or '(1 2 3), but just (1 2 3) would be erroneous.
Likewise, (number-sequence 1 3) is a valid expression denoting a list.

As usual, if DEFINITION is a string, it cannot contain the ‘\’ character;
which is sidestepped via the Unicode character ‘╲’.

The arguments FROM, LET, BECOME, WHERE, IS are completely irrelevant.
They only serve to allow users to have *readable* syntax ---and flexibly so.
Here are examples of a valid invocations.

Wordy as in Python:

_ = declare for x in (𝟙 𝟚 𝟛) let (format \"CarrierU%s\" x) = (Carrier renaming \"U to 𝒰\") where 𝒰 = (format \"U%s\" x)

Terse as in Haskell:
_ = declare for x ∈ (𝟙 𝟚 𝟛) ∷ (format \"CarrierU%s\" x) = (Carrier renaming \"U to 𝒰\")  ⇐  𝒰 = (format \"U%s\" x)

It is important to remember that “declare” is not a builtin keyword, it is the name of a PackageFormer
---we have chosen to name the empty PackageFormer “declare” as it makes the resulting invocation readable.
The LHS “_” means that this invocation is used for its side-effects, to produce new PackageFormers,
rather than for producing a PackageFormer by altering the given one, “declare”.

The LHS could be given any name which then serves to *document* the purpose of the loop;
e.g., “CarrierU𝒾⟵𝒾∶1…3” for the above clauses. This is cool: WE HAVE NAMED DECLARATIONS.

:Changelog:
+ [X] Remove eval-and-compile and close melpa PR.
+ [X] Reconfigured how instate mixfix support; e.g., AbealianMonoidR to go through.
+ [X] NEW, section on contributions and current state of affairs.
+ [X] NEW, variational for substructures; not yet publicly documented.
+ [X] Switched some variationals to use symbolic names instead of strings as arguments.
      This' achieved by the following approach: All arguments to variationals are
      automatically “quote”ed before being passed to the underlying, 𝒱- prefixed, lisp function.
+ [X] Accounted for a clever renaming scheme: when R ↦ R′, then element names
      such as R-this automatically map to R′-this, and so are consistent
      with expected uses.
+ [X] NEW, 200+ mathscheme theories formalised, elaborating into typecheckable Agda ^_^
+ [X] Added some ideas on semantics to section 2.

- [X] subscript levels are supported in types of PackageFormers.

:more_ideas:
[ ] In abstract, mention how the meta-primitives and provided interface allow the current system
    to be used as a quick-n-dirty sandbox for experimenting on novel concepts of grouping mechanisms
    and operations upon them.

[ ] Provide support for multi-line element parsing, so that 𝕀-unique looks nice!

[ ] Add to abstract words about extensions, union, flipping, freely created views, PL research is about getting stuff for free,
    and support for equations ---i.e., transport of results via variationals.

[ ] All M-Set-Record instantiations have their resulting Agda, in the user manual, missing the new elements. Go fix this.

[ ] Mention how we solve RATH's duality issue, such as join and meet semilattices using a flipping variational.

[ ] Simplify 𝒱-map's “f = f” issue using the “let f = f in” trick; c.f. 𝒱-flip.

[ ] Idea: Add ;-to-lists to union that take optional pushout maps (งಠ_ಠ)ง
     ➩ Maybe union takes actual maps, while unioning takes ;-to-list so as to be consisting with renaming and opening.

[ ] In the case of “data”, ⊙, we could provide a semantics mapping.

** Changelog
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: COMMENT-Changelog
   :END:

➩ NEW variational: Extension.
  The resulting extended theory comes with a FREE view to the old, parent, theory.

➩ NEW variational: Union.
  The resulting extended theory comes with two FREE views to the old, parent, theories.

➩ NEW variational: Flipping.
  The variational supports renaming of dualised concepts.
  The resulting extended theory comes with a FREE view to the old, parent, theory.

➩ Resurrected variational: keeping.
  Essentially an opposite of extend-by.
  This lets us perform little theories after the fact; c.f. user manual part I.

➩ Fixed bug regarding barren top-level PackageFormers; e.g.,
  “PackageFormer Empty : Set₁ where” now parses correctly.

➩ Split up user manual into multiple sections.
  First section is motivational; inspired by §2 of Theory Presentation Combinators paper.
  Second section is now for more ‘advanced’ issues.

➩ A listing of variationals borne from the 5 meta-primitives is added to the user manual.

➩ Fixed bug with renaming: It was an issue with 𝒱-map.

➩ 𝒱-map now accounts for view morphisms: Items of the form “f = f” only have RHS instance altered.
  Moreover, it /optionally/ produces retract morphisms! ^_^

➩ Experimented with Emacs Lisp namespacing.
  I wish Elisp had proper modules; this issue will stall the melpa release of this system.

 ### Backend ###

 + [X] Added “λ x → ⋯” macro to reduce burden for Agda users in using Lisp.
 + [X] Typed-name string pairs have been replaced with the “element” datatype.
       Which comes with projections “element-X” and map operations “map-X”,
       as well as a number of other useful functions I needed: replace, parse, etc.
       ➩ Updated prototype to make use of this type instead of string typed-name pairs.
 + [X] Awkward “waist-strings” replaced by natural “element” datatype.
 + [X] The “:key value” syntax is no longer forced onto the user.
       Instead, all arguments are positional unless enclosed in parenthesis
       possibly along with a default value, then they are accessed as key-value pairs.
       ➩ The telescope style to arguments was suggested by Wolfram.
 + [X] Have begun using “declare-type” as a typing mechanism; unsure about this
       since it cannot yet handle arguments mentioning “:”, and also no convenient
       way to temporarily rid a function of a fixed type. Things to consider improving.
 + [X] Switched to /copying/ $𝒆𝑙𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠 rather than exposing them directly, so that
       shared memory locations are not altered accidentally.
 + [ ] Tried to add support for lagda files ---still does not work as desired; not exposed.
 + [X] Tooltips do not affect subwords, only whole words.

 ### User manual ###
 + [X] Switched to a literate approach for examples: All examples tangle to legitimate
       Agda files, which can easily be checked with C-c C-l.
       As such, it's easy to ensure all examples are up-to-date ^_^
 + [X] New section on empty variationals that aims to document all possible things
       with variationals ---including user documentation and optional arguments ^_^
 + [X] Updated nearly all of user manual to reflect the new structure of the
       prototype.
 + [X] Keeping track of a “standard library” of useful variationals to export with
       the prototype (•̀ᴗ•́)و
       ➩ They all come with useful documentation as well as some optional arguments
         for exceptional circumstances.
 + [X] New variationals:
   - [co-]decorated :: Renaming by simple provided decorations.
   - subscriptedᵢ :: Renaming by a subscript 𝒾.
   - primed :: Renaming by a prime.
   - single-sorted :: Collapse a multisorted structure by identifying all sorts.
   - data :: What the gpce19 paper calls termtype; perhaps ought to provide it as an alias.
   - exposing :: Which is misnamed, it should be unbundling, as in the gpce19 paper.

 ## Webpage ###
 + [X] New and stylish webpage style ^_^
 + [X] All headings now have reasonable HTML anchors.


 TODO:
 + [ ] Noticed ~M-Set ⟴ subscripted₃~ crashes for some reason, possibly due to a printing
       error.

 + [ ] Remove global ~*parent-context*~; it's unsued.

 + [ ] Incorporate record-with-discard-equations into user manual.
       ➩ What about all the existing variationals.
       ➩ Revise main example to include equations, as in the gpce19 paper.
         ➩ Perhaps some derived properties of M-Sets?

 + [ ] Add the necessary “quote” in the definition of 𝒱𝒸 so that arguments passed to
       other variationals need not be quoted. This is a bug that exposes how 𝓥 works!

 + [ ] Add support for \begin{lisp}   and \begin{700}
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 [X] Formed variationals ~termtype~ and ~termtype-with-variables~ for syntactic types.
 [X] Variationals may now have optional documentation, viewable with “C-h o” ^_^
     [X] Even better, such docs are displayed as tooltips (•̀ᴗ•́)و
 [X] Elaborated code is attached to its named declaration via tooltips.
 [X] Formed variationals ~recordₑ~ and ~termtypeₑ~ that extend the non-ₑ counterparts by accounting for equations.
 [X] Paper0.agda now contains real working code for all the examples mentioned in Paper0, and then some ;-)
   - E.g., the “concatᵢ” are now generated from a *single* definition (งಠ_ಠ)ง
   - Added an appendix in response to editorial remarks.
 [X] Extended the “map” variational to accomodate PackageFormers with equations. ♥‿♥

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   All issues have been addressed.

   [X] Added a top-level link to this document from 700 github.io website.

   [X] Added new menu item: A bare-bones presentation of a file, with 700-annotations
       stripped out, is now provided.

   [X] Moved prototype material into its own directory ---tackling issue #5.

   [X] Included a comment in §2.9 addressing issue #10 to reduce ambiguity.

   [X] Trying a different colour scheme for the exported HTML
       ---exporting in spacemacs-light theme.

   [X] The meta-primitive is “:kind”, not  “:type” which is an overloaded word.
       The codebase and examples now refer to the former exclusively;
       addersing issue #7.

   [X] Added further docs to §2.5/2.6 to clarify that the main difference between
       the two is that the former does things directly, whereas the latter uses
       composition instead. This addresses issue #9.

   [X] Issue #8 has been addressed. A new todo has been added:
       → Examples from the user-manual
         should be exported into an Agda file which is then easily checked;
         or the resulting generated code should be generated when export happens.

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   [X] Lots of cleaning at the backend.
       → *Sequential* porting currently broken.

   [X] Added two new menu items for locating variationals and PackageFormers.

   [X] Added menu item for folding away “700” and “lisp” blocks.

   [X] Begun updating Paper0

   [X] NEW, Paper0.agda for implementations of the code in Paper0.agda (•̀ᴗ•́)و

   [X] Colouring in PackageFormer syntax is now enabled.

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   [X] Updated user manual; new derived constructs include ~open, open-with~.
       These required we expose a new reference: $𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡.

   [X] Demonstrated how homomorphism constructions may be automated; as well
       as how /easily/ alter automted names with user-provided names!

   [X] Introduced ~rename_~ and ~renaming_~ for rewrites that provide no special attention to underscores.

   [X] ~waist-strings~ expressions now needen't be quoted /and/ may have
       arbitrary Lisp expressions as elements (•̀ᴗ•́)و

       This was necessary for the homomorphism construction to be
       sufficiently generic.

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   [X] Now parsing {-lisp -} comments; which must contain a single Lisp form
       ---or multiple if enclosed in a progn.

   [X] Updated user manual; improved definition of /derived/ construct ~map~.
       New derived constructs include: ~renaming, rename, [co]decorated~;
       as well as ~single-sorted, generated~.

   [X] Composition, ⟴, now actually composes variationals!
       Non-functional primitives are overwritten,
       alteration primitive is composed sequentially.

   [X] Introduced reference $𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠. Used this to derive primitive ~signature~.

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 1. Dropped the *builtin* variation tags, ‘v’,
    in-favour of *extensible* “variationals”
    ---which may even have arguments! ♥‿♥

    → §2.3 demonstrates how to use meta-primitives to
      form common built-in operations.
    → §2.4 uses the variationals from §2.3 to solve
      a common problem.

    The monster functions “instantiate” and “reify-package-formers”
    are now much much more manageable: All the built-in logic to
    cater to particular operations on grouping mechanisms has been
    thrown away in favour of a general template.

 2. Solve the single-sorted problem.
    → Motivating example in §1 is now two sorted!
    → §2.3 shows how it can be used and even reduced to a single sort.

 3. Massive re-organisation:
    → At the document level
    → At the code level
    → At the design level
      ➱ The presentation of PackageFormers has changed from that in
        the thesis proposal and in Paper0.

   :CUSTOM_ID: COMMENT-Feedback

   :PROPERTIES:

   :END:

 [X] Could I get an option to generate a more 'bare' agda, i.e. stripping
 out the 700-commands? [I agree with the default of keeping them in]

 [X] I really like the care in the error reporting (section 2.3)

 [X] the very 90s-web colour choices do get quite tiring...  The colour
 differences of the 3 lines of text at the end of 2.3 is almost
 imperceptible.

    ➱ MA: Switch to spacemacs theme before export.

 [ ] the "level dec" (and "level inc") feature is nice and also too
 low-level. This one is definitely worth thinking about more.

 [ ] I still heavily disagree with your naming of this as 'typeclass'. It
 is as much an illusion as input/output in relations.

 [ ] :alter-elements is some serious syntactic meta-programming! That one's
 going to be hard to generalize. But it is also worth thinking about.

 [ ] 2.7 "Records provide a semantics, what if we want the syntax?" While I
 100% agree with you, this is kind of a short-hand means of communication
 that works within a small group of people at McMaster, and that might be
 it. For external understandability, you're going to greatly expand on
 what you mean here.

 [ ] The reasoning in "Forming syntax" is sound - but how to go from that
 into something that makes sense at a higher level is tricky. You might
 want to read a textbook or two on Universal Algebra, and see how they
 deal with Term Algebras.

 [ ] 2.8 Nice. And many of the comments above apply.

 [ ] 2.9 ":level none" seems to be a serious hack to deal with modules vs
 records!  But the feature is very cool.

 [ ] 2.10 does clearly points to the need of dealing with "dependency
 graphs" when you move beyond syntactic meta-programming. But the reward
 is definitely non-trivial.

 [ ] 2.11 nice. You should compare with the same idea in Universal Algebra.
 And think of how to do this without so much syntax munging.
    But I agree, quite cool.

    Here's a very (very!) hard test: From Category, apply homomorphism
 once to get Functor, again to get NaturalTransformation, again to get
 Modification, again to get perturbation (Functor is a 0-transfor,
 pertubations are 3-transfors; there's a nice periodic table at
 https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/transfor).

 [X] Won't comment on sections 3,4,5,6,7 in detail as these are
 implementation details of the prototype. They are excellent to see all
 spelled out like this. The important part is to really understand the
 meaning of the stuff in section 2.

 [ ] It's going to be worth prioritizing that Future Work section.

 [ ] Last meta-comment: this is a very operational description of the work,
 which is great for a tutorial. You need to also start thinking about
 bringing in stronger motivation for the usefulness of the various
 pieces. All your examples might be self-evident to you, but never assume
 that of your reader.

 [X] Summary: very cool. Solid progress in the right direction. Continue!

  The Vector & Scalar sorts are exposed!
  Moreover, the level of the resulting record is as minimal as possible ^_^ Neato! 🐺

  # What about a bundled up record declaration? Simple, we leave the waist with default value zero.

  Records provide a semantics, what if we want the syntax?
  Since ~data~ declarations consist of constructors, whose target type necessarily
  begins with the name of the ~data~-type being defined, let's only keep those fields and drop the rest.

  First, a helper function.
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle agda-next-700-module-systems.el
(defun target (field)
  "Given a declaration “name : type0 → ⋯ → typeN”, yield “typeN”. "

  Let's test it out:
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var test = test :exports both :results replace
(-let [pf-name "Semigroup-syntax"]

  (list (s-contains? pf-name (target "Id    :  Semigroup-syntax"))
    (s-contains? pf-name (target "_⨾_   :  Semigroup-syntax → Semigroup-syntax → Semigroup-syntax"))
    (s-contains? pf-name (target "assoc :  ∀ {x y z} → (x ⨾ y) ⨾ z ≡ x ⨾ (y ⨾ z)"))
    (s-contains? pf-name (target "Semigroup-syntax : Set")))
)
  #+END_SRC

  #+RESULTS:
  | t | t | nil | t |

  As the last test case shows, the name position of a declaration could have
  a data-type name --which is not allowed in Agda since constructors share the
  same namespace as types, yet this property is not ensured in our generation;
  so let's sanitise for it.

  Now a real use case.

  Notice that $𝑛𝑎𝑚𝑒 is a special variable that refers to the newly defined PackageFormer's name.
  - It is written using ~\Mi~ with Agda input; e.g., ~\Min~ gives ~𝑛~.
  - The ‘$’ is intended to further mark the special nature of this variable.

  Yeehaw! We've got three variations and possibly much more from a small core interface
  🤠 We can emulate generative modules this way too! 😻

  Let's package these particular toggle configurations into their own functions.

TODO: Maintain a list of instantations-loaded, then use that to obtain
the elements of an instance to determine how an ‘opening’ should be
performed. For example, given ⟪params ❙ fields⟫ we know that the
opening module must have ⟪params, ℛ : instance⟫ as parameters,
and the remaining list of fields will then avilable for renaming.
This scheme will work for arbitrary typeclasses ^_^

:Threading_Remarks:

;; The “thread-first x forms” syntax feeds initial value ‘x’ as the first argument into the
;; next form, which in-turn is then fed as the first argument to the form following it, and so on.
;; It provides a nice way to avoid lots of parenthesising on a particular argument; thereby being clearer.
;;
;; (insert (format "\n⇒ %s" (macroexpand '(thread-first x₀ (f₁ x₁¹ … x¹ₘ) ⋯ (fₙ xₙ¹ … xⁿₖ)))))
;; ⇒ (fₙ (⋯ (f₁ x₀ x₁¹ … x¹ₘ)) xₙ¹ … xⁿₖ)
;;
;; A simple implementation can be found [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ThreadMacroFromClojure][here]].
;;
;; Dually, thread-last behaves the same but being at the final-most
;; form position;
;; that is, it is essentially “forwards function application”.
;; More generally, the dash library provides ‘-as->’ which allows us to bind a name
;; such as ‘res’, which is then an alias for all intermediate results.
;;
;; (insert (format "\n⇒ %s" (macroexpand '(-as-> x₀ res (f₁ x₁¹ … res ⋯ x¹ₘ) ⋯res⋯))))
;; ⇒ (let ((res x₀)) (-as-> (f₁ x₁¹ … res ⋯ x¹ₘ) res ⋯res⋯))
;;
;; It is defined recursively to make use of the same name.
;;
;; The operator ‘-->’ uses the name ‘it’ by default.

This article is about implementing a prototype supporting [[https://alhassy.github.io/next-700-module-systems/][“the next 700 module systems” proposal]]
as an editor extension. In particular, we show how intimately related presentations of a type
can be /derived automatically/ from a single generic declaration which we call a ~PackageFormer~.

Think of a language that does not support currying and you need to have a function of
10 arguments that needs to support accepting any number of arguments less than 10, say
for partial application. In such languages, one must utilise the builder design pattern,
or quickly copy-paste the function 10 times, altering it slightly each time.
In general, if such a function definition requires /N/ lines and /M/ forms of the function
are needed, then nearly /N × M/ lines of code are written manually.

Our prototype deals with this problem, among others, for functions on /types/
---i.e., type constructors--- and reduces this quadratic count to a linear
count /N + M/: One declaration of /N/ lines, then /M/ lines, each being an instantiation
of the desired form. These ideas are discussed in the pre-print
[[../papers/gpce19_a_language_feature_to_unbundle_data_at_will.pdf][A Language Feature to Unbundle Data at Will]].

*Design patterns for theories become library methods!*
An interesting side-effect of having meta-primitives for packages
is that traditional patterns for theories
---e.g., homomorphisms, syntax, interpretation functions---
can now be codified as general re-usable methods.

The ideas are targeted to the dependently-typed language Agda.
However, with little alterations they could easily be made to target
other languages, such as Haskell and Coq. The ideas transcend the presentation
language, Agda. Ideally, variational definitions would also be in the host
language rather than in Lisp but that would require alteration to the host
language itself, and Lisp with Emacs hooks is much easier to do; for now.
/This is an Emacs centric language extension./

The [[Aim: /Scrap the Repetition/][first section]] below quickly elaborates on our goal,
after that is a ‘[[#User-Manual][user manual]]’ then the remainder of
the article serves as literate documentation of the prototype;
as well as an opportunity for me to explore emojis.
To follow along, it may be useful to look at an [[https://alhassy.github.io/ElispCheatSheet/][Elisp Cheat Sheet]].

The user manual, among other things, shows how we can avoid the
~open ⋯ public ⋯ renaming ⋯~ pattern which [[http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~nad/listings/lib/Algebra.Structures.html#2757][plagues]] Agda's standard library
---and is much more pronounced in the [[http://relmics.mcmaster.ca/RATH-Agda/RATH-Agda-2.2.pdf][RATH-Agda]], which devotes p27-39 for simple setoid renaming
and does much more elsewhere---,
as well as showing how to avoid [[http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~nad/listings/lib/Algebra.Morphism.html#1][laborious]], yet tedious, definitions of homomorphisms
in Agda's library. Moreover, the motivating factor of this work is to avoid
the pattern of [[http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~nad/listings/lib/Algebra.Structures.html#1][defining a predicate]] ~IsX c₀ ⋯ cₙ~ on constituents ~cᵢ~
[[http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~nad/listings/lib/Algebra.html#1][then packaging]] the constituents along with a proof of this predicate as a record ~X~.

This is a more than a <<<200% increase>>> in size; that is, our fictitious code will
save us a lot of repetition.

The above is ideal syntax: In Lisp fashion, we are not limiting our vision to what
we can currently be done. The actual syntax that is currently supported by this
program is surprisingly close to the above, with an occasional ~-~ or ~:~ inserted.
Just look at the following source file and resulting generated code!

{{{fold(package-former.agda)}}}
#+INCLUDE: "package-former.agda" src agda
{{{end-fold}}}

{{{fold(package-former-generated.agda)}}}
#+INCLUDE: "package-former-generated.agda" src agda
{{{end-fold}}}

Above is a sample source file which contains special comments that are picked up
by the prototype which then copy-paste-cuts to produce a generated file.
The above code is discussed below, in the user manual
---in fact, it's generated from the user-manual below.

 For this prototype, we have the following <<<constraints>>>:

1. The type of a PackageFormer is ~Set ℓ~ where ~ℓ~ is the empty string
   or a parenthesised expression of type ~Level~.
   - Subscript levels are supported.

2. The ~where~ keyword appears on the same line as the ~PackageFormer~ key-phrase.

3. The name of the PackageFormer should not contain ~PackageFormer~ as a sub-identifier.

4. Each element of a PackageFormer spans only /one/ physical line.

There are many useful features outlined in the proposal, such as default implementations, that we
hope to include in the future. For now, we just want something that works, is decently documented, and
can be useful.

  :CUSTOM_ID: Contributions

  # Motivation

*Current state of affairs:*

1. Expressive & extendable specification language for the library developer.
   - We demonstrate that our meta-primitives permit this below by demonstrating
     that ubiquitous module combinators can be easily formalised /and/ easily used.
   - E.g., from a theory we can derive its homomorphism type, signature, its termtype, etc;
     we generate useful constructions inspired from universal algebra.
   - An example of the freedom allotted by the extensible nature of the system is that
     combinators defined by library developers can, say, utilise auto-generated names
     when names are irrelevant, use ‘clever’ default names, and allow end-users to supply
     desirable names on demand.

2. Unobtrusive and a tremendously simple interface to the end user.
   - Once a library is developed using (the current implementation of) PackageFormers, the
     end user only needs to reference the resulting generated Agda, without any knowledge of the existence
     of PackageFormers.
     * Generated modules are necessarily ‘flattened’ for typechecking with Agda.
   - We demonstrate below how end-users can build upon a library by using /one line/ specifications,
     by showing over over 200 specifications of mathematical structures.

3. Efficient: Our current implementation processes over 200 specifications in ~3 seconds; yielding typechecked Agda code.
   - It is the typechecking that takes time.

4. Pragmatic: We demonstrate how common combinators can be defined for library developers, but also how they can
   be furnished with concrete syntax ---inspired by Agda's--- for use by end-users.

5. Minimal: The system is essentially invariant over the underlying type system; with the exception of
   the meta-primitive ~:waist~ which requires a dependent type theory to express ‘unbundling’ component fields as parameters.

6. Demonstrated expressive power /and/ use-cases.
   - Common boiler-plate idioms in the standard Agda library, and other places,
     are provided with terse solutions using the PackageFormer system.
     * E.g., automatically generating homomorphism types and wholesale renaming fields
       using a single function.
   - Over 200 modules are formalised as one-line specifications.

7. Immediately useable to end-users /and/ library developers.
   + We have provided a large library to experiment with
     ---thanks to the MathScheme group for providing an adaptable source file.
   + In the second part of the user manual, we show how to formulate module
     combinators using a simple and straightforward subset of Emacs Lisp ---a terse introduction is provided.

*Intuitively, the nature of the meta-primitives:*
1. A ~PackageFormer~ is a context, a signature, an essentially algebraic theory of Freyd, or a generalised algebraic theory of Cartmell.
   Moreover, it is tagged by some values for practical purposes; e.g., the kind of concrete realisation that is possible in Agda ---namely, ~record, data, module,~ or
   the abstract ~PackageFormer~.
2. A ‘variational’ is a morphism between PackageFormers ---taking signatures to signatures.

   Built up from the grammar:
   #+BEGIN_SRC haskell :tangle no
𝓋 ∷=                   -- empty, identity, variational
   | 𝓋 ⟴ 𝓋            -- composition
   | :kind  𝓀          -- 𝓀 ∈ {record, data, module, PackageFormer}
   | :waist 𝓃          -- n ∈ ℕ, number of initial items to be considered as ‘parameters’
   | :alter-elements 𝒻 -- f : List Elements → List Elements
   #+END_SRC

   ~:alter-elements~ is a sledgehammer that may result in ill-formed signatures, but we leave it in the system due to its power.
   Instead, we recommend using the following derivied primitives for signature catenation, map, and filter:
   #+BEGIN_SRC haskell :tangle no
   | extended-by ds  -- Adjoin declarations ds, “name : type”, to a PackageFormer
   | map         f   -- Alter each element by f : Element → Element
   | generated   f   -- Keep the largest well-formed PackageFormer whose elements satisfy predicate f
#+END_SRC

   Why are these sufficient? The first homomorphism theorem of lists ---i.e., the fact that lists are free monoids---
   informs us that all well-behaved functions from a list monoid are determined as folds after maps. Since our signatures
   are essentially free monoids and the target of our functions are again the same free monoids, the fold is determined and only
   the map remains. We conjecture this is enough; we are not yet certain.

   Interestingly, we are mostly generic over the underlying type theory.

   #  Γ extended-by x₀:τ₀,…,xₙ:τₙ  -- where Γ,x₀:τ₀,…,xₖ₋₁:τₖ₋₁ ⊢ τₖ Type

   Since a ~PackageFormer~ corresponds to a signature, then these variationals
   ---at least the well-behaved ones--- correspond to signature morphisms.
   Great difficulty lies in providing semantics for ~alter-elements~; if
   we demand a well-typedness judgement, “⊢”, from our underlying type theory
   then we could define ~(x₀ : τ₀, …, xₙ ∶ τₙ) = Γ :alter-elements f~ to be well-typed iff
   ~f : List Elements → List Elements~ and ~x₀:τ₀,…,xₖ₋₁:τₖ₋₁ ⊢ τₖ Type~ for ~k : 0..n~;
   likewise if we admit defined constants in our contexts.

   :functorial_semantics:
Object-level Semantics -- “functorial semantics”
- ⟦_⟧ : PF ⟶ |ℂ|
- ⟦Empty⟧ = ()  -- the empty context
- ⟦Γ extended-by Δ⟧ = ⟦Γ⟧ ++ Δ
- ⟦Γ :waist n⟧ = ???
- ⟦Γ :kind k⟧  = ???
- ⟦Γ :map f⟧   = map f ⟦Γ⟧
- ⟦Γ :filter p⟧ = filter p ⟦Γ⟧
- ⟦Γ A ⟴ B⟧ = ⟦ ⟦Γ A⟧ B ⟧ -- get a context, then apply B to that.
:end:

3. We have a categorical structure consisting of PackageFormers as objects and those variationals that are signature morphisms.

*Research outcomes:*
1. Narrow down the meta-primitives that permit a variety of algorithms for generating universal
   algebra consructions ---the former being the kerneal which has application the latter.
2. Realise this for Agda, likely using an editor-extension.
3. Provide a semantics to the existing syntax.
4. Ensure the resulting semantics is consistent with that of Agda's.

If the previous section is unclear regarding the aims and uses of this prototype,
please consult the pre-print [[../papers/gpce19_a_language_feature_to_unbundle_data_at_will.pdf][A Language Feature to Unbundle Data at Will]]
or [[https://alhassy.github.io/next-700-module-systems/][the next 700 module systems proposal]].

Herein we demonstrate how to use this system from the perspective of /library designers/.
We use constructs that are discussed in the next section ---which are examples of how
users may extend the system to produce grouping mechanisms for any desired purpose.
The exposition here follows section 2 of the /Theory Presentation Combinators/ [cite:tpc]
paper, reiterating many the ideas therein.

The few constructs demonstrated in this section not only create new grouping mechanisms
from old ones, but also create maps from the new, child, presentations to the old parent
presentations. Maps between grouping mechanisms are sometimes called /views/.
For example, a theory extended by new declarations comes equipped with
a map that forgets the new declarations to obtain an instance of the original theory.
Such morphisms are tedious to write out, and our system provides them for free.
How? You, the user, can implement such features using our 5 meta-primitives
---but we have implemented a few for you as examples.

It is important to clarify that *the purpose of this work is the development of a core kernel of meta-primitives for modules*. This section demonstrates the power and
expressivity of the meta-primitives by showcasing a series of ubiquitous combinators
/which may be defined using the meta-primitives and Lisp/. The section afterwards goes into the detail of how to *extend the system to build any desired operations on any notion of grouping mechanism*.
#+end_center

# As such, some of the definitions of combinators are biased or have some shortcomings:
# Our goal is to show the meta-primitives allow for such definitions, and to provide
# examples (mostly in the second part of the user manual) for users to build what they want.

** Syntax
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: Syntax
   :END:

{{{goal(Superficial glance at the system's syntax.)}}}

The prototype works by translating fictitious 700-syntax into legitimate Agda;
as follows:
#+BEGIN_SRC agda :tangle no
...agda code here...
{-700
       ...700-syntactical items here...
-}
...more agda code...
#+END_SRC
Since the first section provides an example source fragment with both 700-comments as well
as instantiations, we shall only enclose 700-syntax in 700-comments when it is surrounded
by other Agda code, and otherwise leave it free standing.

/We will provide full source listings at the end of discussions that only display fragments!/

 <<<700-syntax>>> is defined informally as follows:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE text
⟪700-syntax⟫    ::=  ⟪PackageFormer⟫ | ⟪Instantiation⟫ | ⟪Agda⟫

⟪PackageFormer⟫ ::= PackageFormer ⟪Identifier⟫ : Set (⟪level⟫) where
               ⟪newline-with-indentation⟫ ⟪Element⟫*

⟪Element⟫       ::=  ⟪Identifier⟫ : ⟪Any-Agda-Type⟫

⟪Instantiation⟫ ::= ⟪Identifier⟫ = ⟪Identifier⟫ ⟪VariationalClause⟫

⟪VariationalClause⟫ ::= [⟪Identifier⟫] (:key (value))* (⟴ ⟪VariationalClause⟫)*
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE text

            | with     ⟪ToList⟫

⟪ToList⟫ ::= (⟪Identifier₀⟫ to ⟪Identifier₀⟫; ⋯; ⟪Identifierₙ⟫ to ⟪Identifierₙ⟫) {- for any n : ℕ -}
#+END_EXAMPLE
:End:

+ One derives many presentations of a grouping mechanism by what we call ‘variational clauses’.
  - In a 700-comment, one declares ‘variational’ such as
     | ~𝒱-typeclass height = :kind record :level dec :waist-strings ("field") :waist height~   |

     These are functions whose names begin with ~𝒱-~, they may have arguments on the left-hand-side,
     and their right hand side may invoke any of the 5 meta-primitives
     ~kind, waist, waist-strings, level, alter-elements~ with any mixture of
     arguments and concrete values.

     # - These is limited Agda syntax support; in doubt, Lisp syntax is used.

     - To invoke a variational in an instantiation clause, arguments are not positional
       but instead are passed by name ---e.g., ~:key value~.

#   Note that package formation has been liberated from the backend and brought to the user
#   via our 5 meta-primitives: preamble, kind, waist, waist-strings, level, alter-elements.

+ Example uses of the variational clauses could be seen in the ~package-former.agda~ listing in the first section above.
** Extension
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: Extension
   :END:

   The simplest situation is where the presentation of one theory is included, verbatim, in another.
   Concretely, consider ~Monoid~ and ~CommutativeMonoid~.

#+BEGIN_SRC agda
{-700
PackageFormer Monoid : Set₁ where
   Carrier : Set
   _·_     : Carrier → Carrier → Carrier
   assoc   : {x y z : Carrier} → (x · y) · z  ≡  x · (y · z)
   𝕀       : Carrier
   leftId  : {x : Carrier} → 𝕀 · x  ≡ x
   rightId : {x : Carrier} → x · 𝕀  ≡ x
   𝕀-unique : ∀ {e} (lid : ∀ {x} → e · x ≡ x) (rid : ∀ {x} → x · e ≡ x) → e ≡ 𝕀
   𝕀-unique lid rid = ≡.trans (≡.sym leftId) rid

PackageFormer CommutativeMonoid₀ : Set₁ where
   Carrier : Set
   _·_     : Carrier → Carrier → Carrier
   assoc   : {x y z : Carrier} → (x · y) · z  ≡  x · (y · z)
   𝕀       : Carrier
   leftId  : {x : Carrier} →  𝕀 · x  ≡ x
   rightId : {x : Carrier} →  x · 𝕀  ≡ x
   comm    : {x y : Carrier} →  x · y  ≡  y · x
   𝕀-unique : ∀ {e} (lid : ∀ {x} → e · x ≡ x) (rid : ∀ {x} → x · e ≡ x) → e ≡ 𝕀
   𝕀-unique lid rid = ≡.trans (≡.sym leftId) rid
-}
#+END_SRC

As expected, the only difference is that ~CommutativeMonoid₀~ adds a ~comm~-utative axiom.
Thus, given ~Monoid~, it would be more economical to define:
#+BEGIN_SRC agda
{-700
CommutativeMonoid = Monoid extended-by "comm : {x y : Carrier} →  x · y  ≡  y · x"
-}
#+END_SRC

Hovering over the left-hand-side gives a tooltip showing the resulting elaboration,
which is identical to ~CommutativeMonoid₀~ along with a forgetful operation 😄
The tooltip shows the /expanded/ version of the theory, which is
*what we want to specify but not what we want to enter manually*.
To obtain this specification of ~CommutativeMonoid~ in the current implementation
of Agda, one would likely declare a record with two fields ---one being a ~Monoid~
and the other being the commutativity constraint--- however, this _only_ gives
the appearance of the above specification for consumers; those who produce instances
of ~CommutativeMonoid~ are then _forced_ to know the particular hierarchy and must provide
a ~Monoid~ value first. It is a happy coincidence that our system alleviates such an issue.

Alternatively, we may reify the new syntactical items as concrete Agda supported ~record~-s as follows.
#+BEGIN_SRC agda
{-700
MonoidR            = Monoid ⟴ record
CommutativeMonoidR = MonoidR extended-by "comm : {x y : Carrier} →  x · y  ≡  y · x" ⟴ record
-}

neato : CommutativeMonoidR → MonoidR
neato = CommutativeMonoidR.toMonoidR
#+END_SRC

*“Transport”*
It is important to notice that the /derived/ result ~𝕀-unique~, while proven in the setting of ~Monoid~,
is not only available via the morphism ~toMonoidR~ but is also available directly since it is also
a member of ~CommutativeMonoidR~.

As a teaser, here's how the ~extended-by~ variational is defined ---we leave the details of which
to the second part of the user manual.
{{{fold(Definition of extended-by)}}}

  See the ~flipping~ variational below.

Anyhow, notice that we may define ~GroupR~ ---a record-presentation of groups--- as an extension of ~MonoidR~
using a /single/ ~extended-by~ clause where the necessary items are separated by ~;~.

   From a library-designer's perspective, our definition of ~CommutativeMonoid~ has the commutativity property ‘hard coded’ into it.
   If we wish to speak of commutative magmas ---types with a single commutative operation--- we need to hard-code the property once again.
   If, at a later time, we wish to move from having arguments be implicit to being explicit then we need to track down every hard-coded
   instance of the property then alter them ---having them in-sync becomes an issue.

   Instead, the system lets us ‘build upon’ the ~extended-by~ combinator: We make an associative list of

#+BEGIN_SRC agda

   An Abealian monoid is /both/ a commutative monoid and also, simply, a monoid.

   comes with a new projection ~toCommutativeMonoidR~, and still has the inherited projection ~toMonoidR~.

   Since renaming and extension (including postulating) both adjoin retract morphisms, by default,
   we are lead to wonder how about the result of performing these operations in sequence ‘on the fly’,
   rather than naming each application. Since ~P renaming X ⟴ postulating Y~ comes with a retract ~toP~ via
   the renaming and another, distinctly defined, ~toP~ via the postulating, we have that the operations
   commute if /only/ the first permits the creation of a retract. Here's a concrete example:
#+BEGIN_SRC agda
{-700
IdempotentMagma  = Magma renaming "_·_ to _⊔_" ⟴ postulating "_⊔_" "idempotent"   :adjoin-retract nil ⟴ record
-}
#+END_SRC

  These both elaborate to the same thing, up to order of constituents.

  It is important to realise that the renaming and postulating combinators are /user-defined/, and
  could have been defined without adjoining a retract by default; consequently, we would have unconditional
  commutativity of these combinators. You, as the user, can make these alternative combinators as follows:
#+BEGIN_SRC agda
{-700

𝒱-renaming′ by = renaming 'by :adjoin-retract nil

𝒱-postulating′ p bop (using) = postulating 'p 'bop :using 'using :adjoin-retract nil

-- Example use: We need the “𝒱-” in the declaration site, but not in use sites, as below.

IdempotentMagma″ = Magma postulating′ "_⊔_" "idempotent" ⟴ renaming′ "_·_ to _⊔_" ⟴ record
-}
#+END_SRC

Super near stuff!

As expected, simultaneous renaming works too ^_^
#+BEGIN_SRC agda
{-700
PackageFormer Two : Set₁ where
  Carrier : Set
  𝟘       : Carrier
  𝟙       : Carrier

TwoR = Two record ⟴ renaming′ "𝟘 to 𝟙; 𝟙 to 𝟘"
-}
#+END_SRC
~TwoR~ is just ~Two~ but as an Agda record, so it typechecks.

Finally, renaming is an invertible operation ---ignoring the adjoined retracts,
~Magmaʳʳ~ is identical to ~Magma~.
#+BEGIN_SRC agda
{-700
Magmaʳ  = Magma  renaming "_·_  to op"
Magmaʳʳ = Magmaʳ renaming "op   to _·_"
-}
#+END_SRC

Alternatively, ~renaming~ has an optional argument ~:adjoin-coretract~ which can be provided
with ~t~ to use a default name or provided with a string to use a desired name for
the inverse part of a projection, ~fromMagma~ below.
#+BEGIN_SRC agda
{-700
Sequential = Magma renaming "op to _⨾_" :adjoin-coretract t
-}
#+END_SRC
#+BEGIN_SRC results-agda :tangle no
record Sequential : Set₁ where
    field Carrier : Set
    field _⨾_     : Carrier → Carrier → Carrier

    toType : let View X = X in View Type
    toType = record {Carrier = Carrier}

    toMagma : let View X = X in View Magma
    toMagma = record {Carrier = Carrier;op = _⨾_}

    fromMagma : let View X = X in Magma → View Sequential
    fromMagma = λ g227742 → record {Carrier = Magma.Carrier g227742;_⨾_ = Magma.op g227742}
#+END_SRC
We are using gensym's for λ-arguments to avoid name clashes.

** Union (and intersection)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: Union
   :END:

But even with these features, given ~GroupR~, we would find ourselves writing:
#+BEGIN_SRC agda
{-700
CommutativeGroupR₀ = GroupR extended-by "comm : {x y : Carrier} →  x · y  ≡  y · x" ⟴ record
-}
#+END_SRC

This is *problematic*: We lose the /relationship/ that every commutative group is a commutative monoid.
This is not an issue of erroneous hierarchical design: From ~Monoid~, we could orthogonally
add a commutativity property or inverse operation; ~CommutativeGroupR₀~ then closes this diamond-loop
by adding both features. The simplest way to share structure is to union two presentations:
#+BEGIN_SRC agda
{-700
CommutativeGroupR = GroupR union CommutativeMonoidR ⟴ record
-}
#+END_SRC

The resulting record, ~CommutativeMonoidR~, comes with three derived fields
---~toMonoidR, toGroupR, toCommutativeMonoidR~--- that retain the results relationships
with its hierarchical construction.

This approach “works” to build a sizeable library, say of the order of 500 concepts, in
a fairly economical way [cite:tpc]. The union operation is an instance of a /pushout/
operation, which consists of 5 arguments ---three objects and two morphisms--- which may
be included into the ~union~ operation as optional keyword arguments.
The more general notion of pushout is required if we were to combine ~GroupR~ with ~AbealianMonoidR~,
which have non-identical syntactic copies of ~MonoidR~.

The pushout of $f : X → A$ and $g : X → B$ is, essentially, the disjoint sum of $A$ and $B$ where embedded elements
are considered ‘indistinguishable’ when the share the same origin in $X$ via the paths $f$ and $g$.
Unfortunately, the resulting ‘indistinguishable’ elements are actually distinguishable: They may be the /A/-name or the /B/-name
and a choice must be made as to which name is preferred since users actually want to refer to them later on.
Hence, to be useful for library construction, the pushout construction actually requires at least another input function
that provides canonical names to the supposedly ‘indistinguishable’ elements.

Since a ~PackageFormer~ is essentially just a /signature/ ---a collection of typed names---, we can make a ‘partial choice of
pushout’ to reduce the number of arguments from 6 to 4 by letting the typed-names object $X$ be ‘inferred’ and encoding
the canonical names function into the operations $f$ and $g$.
The inputs functions $f, g$ are necessarily /signature morphisms/ ---mappings of names that preserve types--- and
so are simply lists associating names of $X$ to names of $A$ and $B$. If we instead consider $f′ : X′ ← A$ and
$g′ : X′ ← B$, in the /opposite direction/, then we may reconstruct a pushout by
setting $X$ to be common image of $f′, g′$, and set $f, g$ to be inclusions
In-particular, the full identity of $X′$ is not necessarily relevant for
the pushout reconstruction and so it may be omitted. Moreover, the issue of canonical names is resolved:
If $a ∈ A$ is intended to be identified with $b ∈ B$ such that the resulting element has $c$ as the chosen
canonical name, then we simply require $f′\, a = c = g′ \, b$.

At first, a pushout construction needs 5 inputs, to be practical it further needs a function for canonical names
for a total of 6 inputs. However, a pushout of $f : X → A$ and $g : X → B$ is intended to be the ‘smallest object $P$
that contains a copy of $A$ and of $B$ sharing the common substructure $X$’, and as such it outputs two functions
$inj₁ : A → P,\, inj₂ : B → P$ that inject the names of $A$ and $B$ into $P$.
If we realise $P$ as a record ---a type of models--- then the embedding functions are /reversed/, to obtain
projections $P → A$ and $P → B$: If we have a model of $P$, then we can forget some structure and rename
via $f$ and $g$ to obtain models of $A$ and $B$.
For the resulting construction to be useful, these names could be automated such as $toA : P → A$ and $toB : P → B$
but such a naming scheme does not scale ---but we shall use it for default names. As such, we need two more inputs
to the pushout construction so the names of the resulting output functions can be used later on.
/Hence, a practical choice of pushout needs 8 inputs!/

Using the above issue to reverse the directions of $f, g$ via $f′, g′$, we can infer the shared structure $X$
and the canonical name function. Likewise, by using $toChild : P → Child$ default-naming scheme, we may omit
the names of the retract functions. If we wish to rename these retracts or simply omit them altogether,
we make the /optional/ arguments: Provide ~:adjoin-retractᵢ "new-function-name"~ to use a new name, or ~nil~ instead
of a string to omit the retract. Here are some examples of this construction of mine.

Here we provide all arguments, optional and otherwise.
#+BEGIN_SRC agda

Remember, /this particular user implementation/ realises ~X₁ union X₂ :renaming₁ f′ :renaming₂ g′~
as the pushout of the inclusions ~f′ X₁ ∩ g′ X₂ ⟶ Xᵢ~ where the source is the set-wise intersection of names.
Moreover, when either ~renamingᵢ~ is omitted, it defaults to the identity function.

The next example is one of the reasons the construction is named ‘union’ instead of ‘pushout’:
It's idempotent, if we ignore the addition of the retract.

A common scenario is extending a structure, say ~Magma~, into orthogonal directions, such as by making
it operation associative or idempotent, then closing the resulting diamond by combining them, to obtain
a semilattice. However, the orthogonal extensions may involve different names and so the resulting
semilattice presentation can only be formed via pushout; below are three ways to form it.

Let's close with the classic example of forming a ring structure by combining two monoidal structures.
This example also serves to further showcasing how using ~𝒱-postulating~ can make for more granular, modular, developments.

    field _+_     : Carrier → Carrier → Carrier

    toType : let View X = X in View Type
    toType = record {Carrier = Carrier}

    toMagma : let View X = X in View Magma
    toMagma = record {Carrier = Carrier;op = _+_}

    field comm       : ∀ x y   → _+_ x y ≡ _+_ y x
    field _×_        : Carrier → Carrier → Carrier

    toAdditive : let View X = X in View Additive
    toAdditive = record {Carrier = Carrier;_+_ = _+_;comm = comm}

    toMultiplicative : let View X = X in View Multiplicative
    toMultiplicative = record {Carrier = Carrier;_×_ = _×_}

    field distˡ      : ∀ x y z → _×_ x (_+_ y z) ≡ _+_ (_×_ x y) (_×_ x z)
#+END_SRC

Following the reasoning for pushouts, we implement pullbacks in the same way with the same optional arguments.
Here's an example use:
#+BEGIN_SRC agda
{-700
Just-Carrier    = Additive intersect Multiplicative
Magma-yet-again = Additive intersect Multiplicative :renaming₁ "_+_ to op" :renaming₂ "_×_ to op"
-}
#+END_SRC
Moreover the absorptive law $X ∩ (X ∪ Z) = X$ also holds for these operations:
~Additive intersect AddMult~ is just ~Additive~, when we ignore all adjoined retracts.

** Duality
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: Duality
   :END:
Maps between grouping mechanisms are sometimes called /views/, which are essentially an internalisation of
of the /variationals/ in our system. Let's demonstrate an example of how dual concepts are
captured concretely in the system.

For example, the dual, or opposite, of a binary operation $_·_$ is the operation $_·ᵒᵖ_$
defined by $x ·ᵒᵖ y ≔ y · x$.
Classically in Agda, duality is utilised as follows:
1. Define a module ~R _·_~ for the desired concepts.
2. Define a shallow module ~Rᵒᵖ _·_~ that opens ~R _·ᵒᵖ_~ and renames the concepts in ~R~
   by the dual names.

   The RATH-Agda library performs essentially this approach, for example for obtaining ~UpperBounds~
   from ~LowerBounds~ in the context of a poset.

Unfortunately, this means that any record definitions in ~R~ must have its field names be
sufficiently generic to play /both/ roles as the original and the dual concept.
Admittedly, RATH-Agda's names are well-chosen; e.g., ~value, boundᵢ, universal~
to denote a value that is a lower/upper bound of two given elements, satisfying
a lub/glb universal property. However, well-chosen names come at an upfront cost:
One must take care to provide sufficiently generic names and account for duality
at the outset, irrespective of whether one /currently/ cares about the dual or not; otherwise
when the dual is later formalised, then the names of the original concept must be refactored
throughout a library and its users.

Consider the following heterogeneous algebra.
#+BEGIN_SRC agda
{-700
PackageFormer LeftUnitalAction : Set₁ where
  Scalar : Set
  Vector : Set
  _·_     : Scalar → Vector → Vector
  𝟙       : Scalar
  leftId  : {x : Vector} → 𝟙 · x ≡ x

-- Let's reify this as a valid Agda record declaration
LeftUnitalActionR  = LeftUnitalAction ⟴ record
-}
#+END_SRC
Informally, one now ‘defines’ a right unital action by duality, flipping the binary operation
and renaming ~leftId~ to be ~rightId~. Such informal parlance is in-fact nearly formally, as the following:
#+BEGIN_SRC agda
{-700
RightUnitalActionR = LeftUnitalActionR flipping "_·_" :renaming "leftId to rightId" ⟴ record
-}
#+END_SRC
Of-course the resulting representation is semantically identical to the previous one, and so it is
furnished with a ~to⋯~ mapping:
#+BEGIN_SRC agda
forget : RightUnitalActionR → LeftUnitalActionR
forget = RightUnitalActionR.toLeftUnitalActionR
#+END_SRC

Likewise for the RATH-Agda library's example from above, to define semi-lattice structures by duality:
#+BEGIN_SRC agda

** Extracting Little Theories
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: Extracting-Little-Theories
   :END:

The ~extended-by~ variational allows Agda users to easily employ the /tiny theories/ [cite:little_theories][mathscheme]
approach to library design: New structures are built from old ones by augmenting one concept at a time,
then one uses mixins such as ~union~, below, to obtain a complex structure.
This approach lets us write a program, or proof, in a context that only
provides what is /necessary/ for that program-proof and nothing more.
In this way, we obtain /maximal generality/ for re-use!
This approach can be construed as /The Interface Segregation Principle [design-patterns-solid]:
/No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use./

#+BEGIN_SRC agda :tangle no
{-700
PackageFormer Empty : Set₁ where {- No elements -}
Type  = Empty extended-by "Carrier : Set"
Magma = Type  extended-by "_·_ : Carrier → Carrier → Carrier"
CommutativeMagma = Magma extended-by "comm : {x y : Carrier} →  x · y  ≡  y · x"
-}
#+END_SRC

The cool thing here is that ~CommutativeMagma~ comes with ~toMagma, toType,~ and ~toEmpty~.

However, life is messy and sometimes one may hurriedly create a structure,
then later realise that they are being forced to depend on unused methods.
Rather than throw an ‘not implemented’ exception or leave them undefined,
we may use the ~keeping~ variational to extract the smallest well-formed
sub-PackageFormer that mentions a given list of identifiers.

For example, suppose we quickly formed ~Monoid~, from earlier, but later wished
to utilise other substrata. This is easily achieved with the following declarations.
#+BEGIN_SRC agda
{-700
Empty″        = Monoid keeping ""
Type″         = Monoid keeping "Carrier"
Magma″        = Monoid keeping "_·_"
Semigroup″    = Monoid keeping "assoc"
PointedMagma″ = Monoid keeping "𝕀; _·_"
-- ↪ Carrier; _·_; 𝕀
-}
#+END_SRC
Even better, we may go about deriving results ---such as theorems or algorithms---
in familiar settings, such as ~Monoid~, only to realise that they are more expressive
than necessary. Such an observation no longer need to be found by inspection, instead
it may be derived mechanically.
#+BEGIN_SRC agda
{-700
LeftUnitalMagma = Monoid keeping "𝕀-unique" ⟴ record
-}
#+END_SRC
This expands to the following theory, minimal enough to derive ~𝕀-unique~.
#+BEGIN_SRC agda-results :tangle no
record LeftUnitalMagma : Set₁ where

   field
     Carrier : Set
     _·_     : Carrier → Carrier → Carrier
     𝕀       : Carrier
     leftId  : {x : Carrier} → 𝕀 · x  ≡ x

   𝕀-unique     : ∀ {e} (lid : ∀ {x} → e · x ≡ x) (rid : ∀ {x} → x · e ≡ x) → e ≡ 𝕀
   𝕀-unique lid rid = ≡.trans (≡.sym leftId) rid
#+END_SRC

Surprisingly, in some sense, ~keeping~ let's us apply the interface segregation principle,
or ‘little theories’, after the fact ---this is also known as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_mathematics][reverse mathematics]].

** 200+ theories -- one line for each

   People should enter terse, readable, specifications that expand into useful,
   typecheckable, code that may be dauntingly larger in textual size.

 The following listing of structures was adapted from the source of a
 MathScheme library cite:tpc,mathscheme, which in turn was inspired by
 the web lists of [[http://math.chapman.edu/~jipsen/structures/doku.php][Peter Jipsen]] and [[http://home.utah.edu/~nahaj/logic/structures/][John Halleck]], and many others from
 Wikipedia and nlab. Totalling over 200 theories which elaborate into
 nearly 1500 lines of typechecked Agda, this demonstrates that our systems works;
 the 750% efficiency savings speak for themselves.

 {{{fold(200+ One Line Specfications)}}}
 #+INCLUDE: "math-scheme.agda" src agda :lines "20-258"
 {{{end-fold}}}

 {{{fold(~1500 Lines of Typechecked Agda)}}}
 #+INCLUDE: "math-scheme-generated.agda" src agda
 {{{end-fold}}}

 If anything, this elaboration demonstrates our tool as useful engineering result.
 The main novelty being the ability for library users to extend the collection
 of operations on packages, modules, and then have it immediately applicable to
 Agda, an executable programming language.

 Since the resulting expanded code is typechecked by Agda, we encountered a number
 of places where non-trivial assumptions accidentally got-by the MathScheme team;
 for example, in a number of places, an arbitrary binary operation occurred multiple
 times leading to ambiguous terms, since no associativity was declared.
 Even if there was an implicit associativity criterion, one would then expect
 multiple copies of such structures, one for each parenthesisation.
 Moreover, there were also certain semantic concerns about the design
 hierarchy that we think are out-of-place, but we chose to leave them as is
 ---e.g., one would think that a “partially ordered magma” would consist of
 a set, an order relation, and a binary operation that is monotonic in both arguments
 wrt to the given relation; however, ~PartiallyOrderedMagma~ instead comes with
 a single monotonicity axiom which is only equivalent to the two monotonicity
 claims in the setting of a monoidal operation.
 Nonetheless, we are grateful for the source file provided by the MathScheme team.
 # Indeed, monotonicity in the second argument cannot be proven from the given
 # law for the operation “x ⟪ y = x” when ≤ is taken to be ≈, and we have 2 points.

 + Unlike other systems, ours does not come with a static set of module operators
   ---it grows dynamically, possibly by you, the user.

 We implore the readers to build upon our code of theories above by, for example,
 define the notion of homomorphism for every single one of the theories.
 Besides being tiresome, such a manual process is also error-prone.
 Instead, one can automatically derive this concept!
 ( The construction of such a variational is delegated to the more involved
 second part of the user manual. )

 Likewise, for other concepts from universal algebra ---which is useful to computer
 science in the setting of specifications.

 Below are the *five meta-primitives* from which all variationals are borne, followed by a few others
 that are useful for extending the system by making your own grouping mechanisms and operations on them.

** User Manual Header
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: User-Manual-Header
   :END:
{{{goal(A literate programming approach to a user manual.)}}}

   In order for our manual's examples to be up-to-date, we will take a literate approach
   to producing them. Namely, the Agda code here is ‘tangled’ from this prose into an Agda
   file which can then be checked by an Agda process. Whence, this file is the de-facto source.

   Let's start-off with a usual Agda header:
#+BEGIN_SRC agda
{- This loads the PackageFormer metaprogram; press C-x C-e after the closing “)” below.                 -}
{- (progn (load-file "~/.emacs.d/agda-next-700-module-systems.el") (agda-next-700-module-systems-mode)) -}

module package-former where

open import package-former-generated
open import Level
open import Data.Bool
open import Data.List using (List; _∷_; []; foldr)
import Relation.Binary.PropositionalEquality as ≡; open ≡ using (_≡_)

{- Let's ensure content of User Manual part I actually type checkes -}
{- Feel free to comment this line out. -}
import package-former-user-manual-i
#+END_SRC
#
# Strip away the 700 annotations with:
# (progn (700-bare-bones) (find-file "Testing_Bare.agda"))

To make the resulting Agda file somewhat self-contained, in case anyone wishes to read that
or load it into Agda and play with it, let's add a blurb.
#+BEGIN_SRC agda
{-
0. There are a number of common use-cases.
1. We can handle all of them & more, since we're extensible.
  - Mention the Lean & Coq, as well as the Agda, repeated fragments.
2. The resulting setup is pragmatic: It is unobtrusive in the
   traditional Agda coding style in that it happens in the background.
3. It fills a particular need; the desire to avoid repetitious code.
-}
#+END_SRC

Before getting to the meat of things, it is important to note that comments
begun with ~{-~ /and/ followed by a space are treated as usual Agda comments,
whereas those /without/ a following space such as ~{-700~ and ~{-lisp~ are picked-up
by our meta-program.

For example, having no space between “{-” and “lisp” would cause the following block to be executed
as a Lisp form.
#+BEGIN_SRC agda
{- lisp
(message-box "Hello")
(message-box "World")
-}
#+END_SRC

Alternatively, here is the PackageFormer for M-Sets from the introduction.
It is a useful example since it is multi-sorted.
#+BEGIN_SRC agda
{-700
PackageFormer M-Set : Set₁ where
   Scalar  : Set
   Vector  : Set
   _·_     : Scalar → Vector → Vector
   𝟙       : Scalar
   _×_     : Scalar → Scalar → Scalar
   leftId  : {𝓋 : Vector}  →  𝟙 · 𝓋  ≡  𝓋
   assoc   : {a b : Scalar} {𝓋 : Vector} → (a × b) · 𝓋  ≡  a · (b · 𝓋)
-}
#+END_SRC
Let us also introduce a slightly more syntactically-involved example:
*A PackageFormer with equations.* The equations, /depending on our perspective,/
---i.e., the variational invoked--- may be thought of as:
+ Derived elements; e.g., in a record, they are a definitional extension
  and for an ADT, they are methods defined on the constructors.
+ Coherence constraints; e.g., in a record, we may interpret an equation ~𝓁 = 𝓇~
  as an additional axiom ~∀ {⋯} → ℓ ≡ 𝓇~ ---e.g., when a user may supply an efficient definition
  of ~𝓁~ but is constrained to have a particular behaviour ~𝓇~.
+ Rewrite rules; e.g., in an ADT, an equation may simply act as an alias and is to be used
  in rewriting the remainder of the ADT declaration.
+ Ignored components; e.g., in a record, we may ignore the equations altogether
  and lift the associated names into being fields ---e.g., ~_≈_~ would usually be lifted into
  a field and its stringent implementation via ~_≡_~ is used as a motivating or simplifying factor.

Notice that there is no particular segregation of declarations and equations.
Simply: A declaration may /optionally/ have an associated equation; however
once an equation uses pattern matching then all subsequent declarations must also
have equations ---this is a constraint of the current Agda implementation---;
as such, the equation for ~⨾-cong~ uses Agda's pattern-matching-λ.

The ~{-700 ⋯ -}~ approach may be acceptable to those writing ~.agda~ files,
but those who write ~.lagda~ files may find themselves often having
~\begin{code} {-700 ⋯ -} \end{code}~ which is rather clunky.
Instead, they may simply write ~\begin{700} ⋯ \end{700}~ and similarly for ~lisp~.

   :END:
{{{goal(A summary of the key features of 𝒱ariationals)}}}

   The simplest user definable variational is the empty one:
#+BEGIN_SRC agda
{-700
-- Variational with empty right hand side.
𝒱-identity =
-}
        #+END_SRC

   The prefix ~𝒱-~ signals to the Elisp meta-program that this particular equation is intended
   to be a variational and should be /loaded into Emacs/ as such. Indeed, you may view the documentation
   and /elaborated/ Lisp of this definition using ~C-h o RET 𝒱-identity~.

   *Remember*: The prefix ~𝒱-~ only occurs at the definition site, the call site omits it.
   Why? We have augmented the Emacs system with a new functional definition, and the 𝒱-
   serves as a namespace delimiter.

   Indeed, we may now perform the following invocation ---within 700-comments.

        #+BEGIN_SRC agda
{-700
MonoidPⁱᵈ = MonoidP identity
-}
        #+END_SRC

 Loading the meta-program using Agda's usual ~C-c C-l~ lets us
 hover over ~MonoidPⁱᵈ~ to see its elaboration is precisely that of ~MonoidP~.

 /Moreover/, to be useful, all variationals
 have tooltips showing their user-defined documentation.
 If we hover over ~identity~, we are informed that it is undocumented.
 User documentation is optional and may appear immediately following the ~=~, as follows.
#+BEGIN_SRC agda
{-700
𝒱-no-op = "This is the do-nothing variational"
-}
        #+END_SRC

We may substitute equals-for-equals:
        #+BEGIN_SRC agda
{-700
-- No variational clauses needed!
MonoidP⁰  = MonoidP
-}
        #+END_SRC

Doing nothing is meaningful with respect to a composition operation.
Momentarily, “⟴” is forwards composition: We ‘thread’ the ~Pf~ through the variationals ~vᵢ~ in order.

        #+BEGIN_SRC agda
{-700
-- Identity of composition ⟴
MonoidPᶜ = MonoidP ⟴
-}
#+END_SRC

| Operationally: ~Pf ⟴ v  ≈  Pf v ⟴  ≈  Pf v~ |

We may also augment a variational with positional and (optional) keyword arguments that have default values.
The keyword arguments along with their default value, /if any/, are enclosed in parenthesis.
#+BEGIN_SRC agda
{-700
𝒱-test positional (keyword 3) another = "I have two mandatory arguments and one keyword argument"

Monoid-test = MonoidP ⟴ test "positional arg₁" "positional arg₂" :keyword 25
-}
#+END_SRC

We are not doing anything with the arguments here; we shall return to this in later subsections.

** ⇨ Errors
   :PROPERTIES:

   :END:
   :PROPERTIES:

   :END:
  Even though this is a prototype, we wish it to be useful to ourselves and to others
  ---especially those who take a quick glance, think they got it, and try things out only to not have them work
  immediately. As such, we have implemented a cute little error-reporting system.
  | If you try to load, ~C-c C-l~, but your 700-syntax is wrong, you get an immediate error explaining why ♥‿♥ |

  For example, suppose we accidentally wrote ~tester~ instead of ~test~, which we defined
  at the end of the previous section, as in the following.
  ( The space before ~700~ is so that this crashing block is not in effect. )
#+BEGIN_SRC agda
{-   700
𝒱-whoops  = tester 1 2 :keyword 3
-}
#+END_SRC
  When we try to load our Agda file the Agda process is interrupted and we are warned:
#+BEGIN_SRC text :tangle no
700: Did you mistype a variational’s name: “tester” is not defined.

    ⇨	whoops = tester 1 2 :keyword 3
    ⇨	Use the PackageFormer menu to see which variationals are defined.
#+END_SRC
  The 700 system informs us of our fault in “quotes”, suggests a solution,
  and points to the offending declaration hierarchy. Neato (•̀ᴗ•́)و

  The “quotes” help, in this case, when there are multiple variationals being
  invoked in a clause.

  Of-course, we do not attempt to cover all possible errors ---e.g., wrong number
  of arguments or division by zero--- instead relying on Emacs Lisp's native
  error mechanism.

** Records and Meta-Primitives ~:kind~ & ~:alter-elements~
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: Records-and-Meta-Primitives---kind------alter-elements-
   :END:
   Let's begin with the simplest thing: Realising these fictitious ‘PackageFormers’ as records.

   An Agda ‘record’ is just a PackageFormer where the qualifier ~PackageFormer~ has been
   replaced with ~record~ and each element is qualified by Agda keyword ~field~.
   We may declare this particular configuration using the meta-primitives
   ~:kind~ and ~:alter-elements~, as follows.
#+BEGIN_SRC agda
{-700
𝒱-record₀ = :kind record :alter-elements (λ es → (--map (map-qualifier (λ _ → "field") it) es))
-}
#+END_SRC

   *Huh?*
   The ~:kind~ part was already explained, the ~:alter-elements~ is the powerhouse of our system.
   It takes a function with argument being the list of PackageFormer elements, ~es~,
   then we perform a functorial list map where each element is implicitly referred to as ~it~.
   Then the map function is to alter the qualifier of an element by replacing it with the string ~"field"~.
   In Agda syntax this corresponds to: ~λ es → map (λ it → (map-qualifier (λ _ → "field") it)) es~.
   \\
   Notice that the Agda form and Lisp form are only one outer parenthesis off from each other ---Lisp is easy!

   | /The ~:key value~ syntax is inspired from Lisp/ |

   Unsurprisingly, we have elected to name this grouping mechanism configuration as ~𝒱-record~.
   Let's try it out.
#+BEGIN_src agda
{-700
M-Set-Record = M-Set record₀
-}
#+END_SRC

   The system picks this up, looks up ~M-Set~ which was defined in the first section earlier,
   looks up the variational ~record~, then runs that configuration to generate:
#+BEGIN_SRC results-agda :tangle no
{- M-Set-Record = M-Set record₀ -}
record M-Set-Record : Set₁ where
   field Scalar     : Set
   field Vector     : Set
   field _·_        : Scalar → Vector → Vector
   field 𝟙      : Scalar
   field _×_        : Scalar → Scalar → Scalar
   field leftId     : {𝓋 : Vector}  →  𝟙 · 𝓋  ≡  𝓋
   field assoc      : {a b : Scalar} {𝓋 : Vector} → (a × b) · 𝓋  ≡  a · (b · 𝓋)
#+END_src

  Nothing too remarkable; the keyword ~field~ has been inserted and the rewrite ~PackageFormer ↦ record~
  has been performed. The above is the /exact/ generated result of the system ---the comment indicates
  the source of this generated code.

** Equation Accommodating Record Variational

  Since record formation is a variational that is likely to be used often, it is sensible to document it
  ---which in turn is attached to all occurences of the variational name via tooltips.
  Moreover, let's strengthen it to accomodate PackageFormers with equations.
#+BEGIN_SRC agda

               "field")) it)))))
-}
#+END_SRC

   Unlike ~𝒱-identity~ from a previous section, we have decided to split this definition into multiple
   lines by enclosing it in ~{-lisp ⋯ -~}~. Such blocks may contain arbitrary Lisp to be executed and so
   all contents must be Lisp forms ---notice the ~𝒱-⋯~ from ~700~-blocks has been *exchanged* for
   a parenthesised (~𝒱 ⋯)~ within ~lisp~-blocks.

   Let's try this out.

    Lid     : Carrier → Carrier ;   Lid x = Id ⨾ x
    Rid     : Carrier → Carrier ;   Rid x = x ⨾ Id
    concat      : List Carrier → Carrier ;  concat = foldr _⨾_ Id
    field leftId        : ∀ {x : Carrier} → (Id ⨾ x) ≈ x
    field rightId       : ∀ {x : Carrier} → Rid x ≈ x

   Yet another option to handling equations is to drop the names that have
   equations associated with them. To tackle such a scenario
   requires the remaining elements to be well-defined and so requires “the largest sub-PackageFormer”.

   Coherent relationships are just graphs in disguise, so let's abstract away the details and solve
   a graph-theoretic problem. In ~{-lisp ⋯ -}~ blocks we may have arbitrary Emacs Lisp code and so include
   the following ---which has a large number of shortcomings, but the aim is a simple demonstration of Lisp
   code for the Agda user, not to be robust Lisp code. The name, <<<graph-map>>>, may not be ideal but it seems good enough, for now.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle "variationals.tmp" :noweb-ref std-𝒱-lib :noweb yes

  (let* (;; Using -map instead of -filter since nodes may become

         (sickly (-map p xs))
         ;; Obtain the items that are currently ‘sickly’.
         (get-sickly (lambda ()

         ;; infected x  ≡ x has a sickly neighbour
         (infected (λ x → (--any (funcall adj x it) (funcall get-sickly)))))

     ;; Propogate sickness.
     (loop for _ in xs
           do (loop for x in xs
                    for i from 0
                    do (when (funcall infected x) (setf (nth i sickly) t))))

            xs))))
#+END_SRC

Here's how this works ---the following is what the incantation
above ~<<docs('graph-map)>>~ refers to, and the reader may ignore all ~<<…>>~
as they are a backend ‘literate programming’ utility.

#+name: graph-map
- F is performed on nodes satisfying P,
  all neighbours are then considered to satisfy P
  and the process repeats recursively.

-  E.g., nodes exhibiting symptoms P are given medicine F,
  and their sickness spreads to their neighbours who in turn
  become ill thereby requiring medication, and the process continues.

- ADJ is a binary relation denoting adjacency.
  + (adj x y)  ≈  “x depends on, or is a neighbour, of y.”

- For example, a graph of 10 nodes, with an edge between multiples;
  where nodes 3, 4, 5 are initally ill.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
   (graph-map (λ x → (-contains-p '(3 4 5) x))

              '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10))

Let's introduce a dedicated form for ~element~ values:
#+name: --graph-map
- Mark elements in a given list, and recursively mark all those that depend on

** Typeclasses ---Parameterised Records--- and Meta-Primitives ~:waist~ & ~:level~
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: Typeclasses----Parameterised-Records----and-Meta-Primitives---waist------level-
   :END:

    We mentioned the <<<“waist”>>> before, but what is it exactly?
    I propose that the difference between ‘field’ and ‘parameter’
    is an illusion ---as is that of ‘input’ and ‘output’ when one
    considers relations rather than deterministic functions.

    For example, let's alter the previous variation declaration to
    lift the waist up 2 positions.
#+BEGIN_src agda
{-700
𝒱-typeclass-attempt = record ⟴ :waist 2
-}
        #+END_SRC

   Notice we have avoided repeating the definition of the ~record~ variational from
   earlier by making use of composition. More on it later, but it suffices to say
   that above we could replace ~record ⟴~ with the exact text of ~𝒱-record = ⋯~ right-hand-side
   and all would continue work.

   Trying this out, below, one notices that the first two elements of the PackageFormer have been lifted
   into being parameters, while the rest have been construed as fields.
       #+BEGIN_SRC agda
{-700
M-Set-TypeClass = M-Set typeclass-attempt
-}
                   #+END_SRC
                   #+BEGIN_SRC results-agda :tangle no
record M-Set-TypeClass (Scalar : Set) (Vector : Set) : Set₁ where
   field _·_        : Scalar → Vector → Vector
   field 𝟙      : Scalar
   field _×_        : Scalar → Scalar → Scalar
   field leftId     : {𝓋 : Vector}  →  𝟙 · 𝓋  ≡  𝓋
   field assoc      : {a b : Scalar} {𝓋 : Vector} → (a × b) · 𝓋  ≡  a · (b · 𝓋)
#+END_src

   While this typechecks according to Agda standards, it is not ideal to human
   standards since the level of the resulting package is larger than necessary.
   The meta-primitive ~:level~ allows us to ~inc~-rement or ~dec~-crement the
   current level of a PackageFormer, so we may instead define:
#+BEGIN_src agda
{-700
𝒱-typeclass₂ = record ⟴ :waist 2 :level dec
MonoidT₂      = MonoidP typeclass₂
-}
        #+END_SRC

        #+BEGIN_SRC results-agda :tangle no
record MonoidT₂ (Carrier : Set) (_⨾_ : Carrier → Carrier → Carrier) : Set where
    field Id        : Carrier
    field assoc     : ∀ {x y z} → (x ⨾ y) ⨾ z ≡ x ⨾ (y ⨾ z)
    field leftId        : ∀ {x : Carrier} → Id ⨾ x ≡ x
    field rightId       : ∀ {x : Carrier} → x ⨾ Id ≡ x
        #+END_SRC

  # Unlike records, typeclasses scream to have an argument: The height of the waist.
  # Variationals may have arguments and we will cover this issue in a later subsection
  # in preference to continuing our purview of the meta-primitives.

  For fun, here are a few more to play with:
#+BEGIN_SRC agda
{-700
MonoidT₃         = MonoidP record ⟴ :waist 3 :level dec
-- MonoidT₃-again   = MonoidP ⟴ record ⟴ unbundling 3
M-Set-Typeclass₂ = M-Set record ⟴ typeclass₂
-}
#+END_SRC

In particular, the last example suggest that our composition is idempotent, but this is clearly not the case.
Indeed, here's a pretty alternative to the meta-primitive ~:waist~ that is not ⟴-idempotent
but is in-fact a homomorphism: ~unbundling n ⟴ unbundling m ≈ unbundling (n + m)~.
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp :tangle "variationals.tmp" :noweb yes :noweb-ref std-𝒱-lib
(𝒱 unbundling n
 = "Make the first N elements as parameters to the PackageFormer.

    Any elements in above the waist line have their equations dropped.
    As such, unbundling is not invertible.
   "
   :waist n
   :alter-elements (λ es →
     (-let [i 0]
       (--graph-map (progn (incf i) (<= i n))
                    (map-equations (-const nil) it)
                    es))))
#+END_SRC
( The graph-map operation was defined in the previous section. )

Incidentally, this solves the problem of lifting the waist to include elements with equations.

   field assoc′     : {a b : Scalar} {𝓋 : Vector} → (a × b) · 𝓋  ≡  a · (b · 𝓋)
{- This is crashing Agda code; as expected. Working improvements below. -}
#+END_src

   There are number of issues to address.

   1. The system comes with a Lisp methods ~map-name~ and ~map-type~ that yield the name and type part,
      respectively, of a PackageFormer element.

   2. The ~:key value~ pairs have legitimate Lisp for the ~value~ positions.

      The basics of list processing, such as maps/filters/folds, with Lisp suffice for a rich
      inventory of possible configurations. Moreover, the functional nature of such higher-order
      functions ought to be familiar to any Agda coder [[https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/worth-ones-salt.html][worth their salt]].

      Here's a terse tutorial rendered as an [[https://alhassy.github.io/ElispCheatSheet/][Elisp Cheat Sheet]].

   3. One would expect catenating a prime to the mixfix name ~_×_~ would yield ~_×_′~ but above
      it yielded ~_×′_~. Indeed, the former would yield confusing expressions of the form
      ~1 × 2 ′~ whereas the latter permits ~1 ×′ 2~. It is with this pragmatic usage that
      ~rename-mixfix~ performs a rewrite to a name by jumping over the Agda mixfix marker, ~_~,
      if it occurs at the start or end of a name.

      As an additional example, the name
      ~_≈_∶_~, under the above scheme, would have rewritten to ~_≈_∶′_~ thereby
      allowing terms such as ~x ≈ y ∶ A  →  f x ≈ f y ∶′ B~ ---a elegant way to
      express that, say, ~f~ is a setoid homomorphism.
      If the prime scheme were instead a prepend, we would have obtained the name
      ~_′≈_∶_~.

   # Notice that the generated code is commented out: The current type of the package
   # is not an admissible construct in Agda.

   # Moreover, if we try to instantiate this package further, say as in    ~M′ = M-Set′-attempt record~

   Notice that
   we have fields such as ~𝟙′ : Scalar~
   whose type is a free variable: ~Scalar~ no longer refers to any field.
   As such, the above code is ill-typed.
   The solution then is to /propagate/ any changes a name has down to its siblings.
   We will return to this later in the form of a ~map~ variational.

   The previous example caused an Agda typechecking error, however if we do not

   which can only be the subject of further alteration via PackageFormer combinators.

#+END_src

    This is interesting: We have not generated a concrete ---legitimate Agda construct---
    but instead yielded a new abstract grouping mechanism which may be instantiated later on,
    whenever desired.

    Likewise, we have already declared ~M-Set-Record = M-Set record~ and now we may apply
    our priming variational.
    #+BEGIN_src results-agda :tangle no
{- M-Set-Record′ = M-Set-Record primed-attempt -}

#+END_src

    | /We may apply  variationals even to concrete Agda packaging constructs!/ |

    Of-course, we may simply want to obtain ~M-Set-Record′~ without having first
    to define ~M-Set-Record~, and so we may use the variational composition operator ~⟴~.

#+BEGIN_src results-agda :tangle no

   field assoc′     : {a b : Scalar} {𝓋 : Vector} → (a × b) · 𝓋  ≡  a · (b · 𝓋)
#+END_src

   Since the ~record~ and ~primed~ configurations are ‘disjoint’, they commute
   with respect to composition. The reader may want to confirm the following identifications:
#+BEGIN_SRC agda :tangle no
      M-Set-Record′
   ≈  M-Set record ⟴ primed-attempt
   ≈  M-Set primed-attempt ⟴ record
   ≈  M-Set′ record
   ≈  M-Set-Record primed-attempt
#+END_SRC

It is important to remember that these primed perspectives do /not/ typecheck in Agda due to the free-variable
issue mentioned earlier. We are only demonstrating composition, ~⟴~, in this section; in a later section we
fix-up ~primed~.

     0. Above we introduced the named arguments ~height~ and ~level~.
     1. The first is positional, and the second is a keyword argument
        with /default/ value being a decrement value.
     2. We then passed the /argument/ ~level~ to the /meta-primitive/ ~:level~.

  This is a prototype; ideally the variational definition would be rendered in
  Agda code. Rather than using functional combinators such as
  ~unzip, map, zip-with~, for diversity, we used imperative constructs.

Important observations include:

1. The Lisp code lives in a ~{-lisp ⋯ -}~ block.

2. 700-comments have single-line ~𝒱-name args = rhs~, whereas lisp-blocks
   have multi-line ~(𝒱 name args = rhs)~ ---the dash after the 𝒱 is gone and outer-most
   parenthesis are added.

3. To provide minimal accommodation for mixfix names, we simply remove the
   Agda argument indicator ‘_’ when performing rewrites.

   E.g., Agda let's you
   declare a name such as ~_⊕_~ and use it without mentioning the underscore
   as in ~x ⊕ y~ and so the rename ~_⊕_ ↦ _⊕′_~ would have no effect since ~_⊕_~
   does not occur as a substring in ~x ⊕ y~, whence the need to ignore the underscores.

Trying it out:

#+name: reify-to-list
- Given a string of “;”-separated items consisting of “to”-separated pairs,
  interpret it as a Lisp function where “to”-pairs denote mapping clauses.

- E.g., “x₀ to y₀; …; xₙ to yₙ” becomes the function sending value xᵢ to yᵢ,
  and behaves as the identity function otherwise unless OTHERWISE is provided,
  in which case it acts as a fallback.

- Concretely:

Some observations are in order:

0. Example ~M₁₂~ demonstrates that composition, ⟴, is sequential from left to right.
   That is, “⟴” is just forwards composition: We thread the given PackageFormer
   through the variationals ~vᵢ~ in order. Operationally:

   | Pf v₀ ⟴ ⋯ ⟴ vₙ ≈ ((Pf v₀) v₁) ⋯) vₙ |
   | Pf ⟴ v  ≈  Pf v ⟴  ≈  Pf v          |

   Note: In the concrete syntax, parenthesisation is not permitted.

1. Notice that the ~NearMonoid~ example demonstrates multiplicity of PackageFormer elements is irrelevant.
   That is, elements are algebraically a free monoid with the axiom ~xs ⊕ ys ⊕ xs ≈ xs ⊕ ys~.

2. *Notice that we wanted  Agda-style renaming via ~to~-lists, so we simply code that up!*
   This is so cool: We can just extend the system with whatever pattern we prefer!
   No more bending to the will of language designers! More power to the user!

   For example, we can codify the previous ~NearMonoid~ scheme into a top-level pattern.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle "variationals.tmp" :noweb yes :noweb-ref std-𝒱-lib
(defun is-sort (element)
  "Check whether the target of ELEMENT’s type is ‘Set’."
  (s-contains? "Set" (target (element-type element))))
  ;; Method ‘target’ is defined in the next subsection, on ADTs.

(𝒱 single-sorted with-sort
  = "Replace all nullary sorts with the provided WITH-SORT string
     as the name of the new single sort, the universe of discourse."
    map (λ e → (if (is-sort e) (map-name (λ _ → with-sort) e) e)))
#+END_SRC

   Then the previous PackageFormer can be obtained with:
   Note that the following differs from ~NearMonoid~ since it has two binary operations:
   Our new variational one alters the number and name of sorts, not other elements.
#+BEGIN_SRC agda
{-700
NearMonoid¹ = M-Set-Record single-sorted "Carrier"
-}
#+END_SRC
#+BEGIN_SRC results-agda :tangle no
record NearMonoid¹ : Set₁ where
   field Carrier        : Set
   field _·_        : Carrier → Carrier → Carrier
   field 𝟙      : Carrier
   field _×_        : Carrier → Carrier → Carrier
   field leftId     : {𝓋 : Carrier}  →  𝟙 · 𝓋  ≡  𝓋
   field assoc      : {a b : Carrier} {𝓋 : Carrier} → (a × b) · 𝓋  ≡  a · (b · 𝓋)
#+END_SRC

*Exercise:*
Write a variational ~remove-sorts~ that strips out all sorts from a PackageFormer.
If elements depend on sorts, as they normally do, then one must remove them as well;
ignore this for now, and we shall return to subgenerated PackageFormers later on.
** Forming Syntax and the Special ~$𝑛𝑎𝑚𝑒~ Variable
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: Forming-Syntax-and-the-Special---𝑛𝑎𝑚𝑒--Variable
   :END:

  |  /Records provide a semantics, what if we want the syntax?/ |

Since ~data~ declarations consist of constructors, whose target type necessarily
begins with the name of the ~data~-type being defined, let's only keep those fields and drop the rest.
To do so, we use the helper function ~target~ which takes a declaration ~name : type0 → ⋯ → typeN~ and yields ~typeN~.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle "variationals.tmp" :noweb yes :noweb-ref std-𝒱-lib
(defun target (thing)
  "Return final type mentioned in THING, a string declaration.

Given a type-name ‘[name :] τ₀ → ⋯ → τₙ’, yield ‘τₙ’;
the ‘name’ porition is irrelevant."
  (car (-take-last 1 (s-split "→" thing))))
#+END_SRC

With this in hand, a ~data~ presentation requires a designated ~carrier~ which is used to
keep only those elements that target it. Finally, as data constructor must target the
type being defined, we alter the filtered elements by changing every instance of the
carrier name with the name of the newly defined PackageFormer ---which we may access
using the special identifier ~$𝑛𝑎𝑚𝑒~. In a ~lisp~ block, we formalise this algorithm as follows.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle "variationals.tmp" :noweb yes :noweb-ref std-𝒱-lib
(𝒱 data carrier
  = "Reify as an Agda “data” type.

     Only elements targeting CARRIER are kept.
    "
    :kind  data
    :level dec
    :alter-elements (lambda (es)
      (thread-last es
        (--filter (s-contains? carrier (target (element-type it))))
        (--map (map-type (λ τ → (s-replace carrier $𝑛𝑎𝑚𝑒 τ)) it)))))
#+END_SRC

For example:
#+BEGIN_SRC agda
{-   700
ScalarTerm = M-Set data "Scalar"
-}
#+END_SRC
#+BEGIN_SRC results-agda :tangle no
data ScalarTerm : Set where
   𝟙        : ScalarTerm
   _×_      : ScalarTerm → ScalarTerm → ScalarTerm
#+END_SRC

Again:
The meta-primitive ~:alter-elements~ is instructed to map over those
elements ~e~ that contain the ~carrier~ in their ~target~ type
by replacing the given ~carrier~ with the newly-minted ~$𝑛𝑎𝑚𝑒~ of
the grouping mechanism being constructed. Those that do not
contain the given ~carrier~ in their target type are filtered out.

Notice that ~$𝑛𝑎𝑚𝑒~ is a special variable that refers to the newly defined PackageFormer's name.
- It is written using ~\Mi~ with Agda input; e.g., ~\Min~ gives ~𝑛~.
- The ‘$’ is intended to further mark the special nature of this variable.

    A common grouping operation is to zoom-in to the minimal well-formed
    package that contains only certain specified elements. For example,
    in our ~M-Set~ grouping, we may want to keep only ~𝟙~ but to be well-defined
    we are forced to also keep the elements on which it depends ---namely, ~Scalar~.

    In particular, the following naive approach only works if the elements are
    independent of one another ---which is rarely the case for Agda users.

    the algorithm below forms a list ~yeses~ of the elements that should be kept

    shallow renames. This pattern is so common that the standard library is [[http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~nad/listings/lib/Algebra.Structures.html#2757][littered]]
    with instances of it.
    We can codify the pattern as a method rather than as a
    manual technique.

    Let's go from zero to one-hundred ---again: There's a Lisp Cheat Sheet that should
    have been consulted at one point.

     WITH is a renaming, string to string, function that is applied to the parent record that will

     AVOID-MIXFIX-RENAMING is optional; by default renaming “jumps over” underscores,
     but providing a non-nil value for this argument leaves underscores alone.
     It is a matter of having, say, default “_⊕ₙ_” versus “_⊕_ₙ”.

     The resulting module has a parameter, whose name is irrelevant but is
     of the form “Arg𝒹𝒹𝒹𝒹” for some digits 𝒹 in order to minimise clash with
     any user-defined names.

     Besides the addition of a new parameter, all element qualifiers are discarded.

  In-case you've skipped over the above source documentation for ~open~, it's time to read it.

  Notice that a module opening depends on a record, whence the first declaration of ~M-Set-R~.

  #+begin_center
   These kind of open-renamings are so common that the tedium
   is actually acceptable by most users ---it shouldn't be
   and now it no longer has to be that way.
  #+end_center

  It is common in Agda to provide “to”-lists, so let's provide a variant that supports those
  instead of forcing users to produce functions explicitly.

After simplifying the ~let~-expressions, this module definition is equivalent to the following
---the types of which may be seen with Agda's ~C-c C-o~ call.
#+BEGIN_SRC agda :tangle no
module M-Set-R-SV (Arg : M-Set-R) where

#+END_SRC

Let's provide an even more common feature: Opening records with a decoration.
For example, when we have two algebraic structures, we might want the first to be subscripted with ₁
and the second with ₂ ---this is different than ~subscriptedᵢ~ from above, which produces a /new/ record
rather than opening it with renames.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle "variationals.tmp" :noweb yes :noweb-ref std-𝒱-lib

It is important to observe that ‘openings’ are lossy:
They lose the types of the declarations and so cannot be used further to construct
new pacaking mechanisms. They are a terminal construction.

  In the next section, we make use of such openings to actually produce
  homomorphism constructions.

#  For now, let's show how /functions are PackageFormers./

    The definition of “structure preservation” is, nearly always, mechanical to
    formulate and that's just what we shall do to avoid having to write it out
    by hand ever again ---which the [[http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~nad/listings/lib/Algebra.Morphism.html#586][current approach]] in the Agda standard library.

    The idea is not too complicated:
    1. Suppose you have an operation ~_·_ : Scalar → Vector → Vector~.
    2. Suppose you have a numbering of the sorts; e.g., ~sort₁ = Scalar, sort₂ = Vector~.
    3. Form functions ~mapᵢ : sortᵢ → sortᵢ′~
    4. Include implicit arguments in the type: ~{x₁ : Scalar} → {x₂ : Vector} → Vector~.
    5. The target type ~Vector = sort₂~ means we need to apply ~map₂~ to the expression
       formed from the operation's name along with the arguments.
       - The left hand side is thus ~map₂ (_·_ x₁ x₂)~.
    6. For the right hand side, we use the target-space's name, say ~_·′_~,
       along with ~mapᵢ~ applied to ~xᵢ~ for each ~i~ mentioned in the type.

    7. The result:
       ~pres-· : {x₁ : Scalar} → {x₂ : Vector} →   map₂ (_·_ x₁ x₂)   ≡   _·′_ (map₁ x₁) (map₂ x₂)~.
      :RoughIdea:
    ⇒  _·_ : sort₁ → sort₂ → sort₂
    ⇒ pres-· : {x₁ : sort₁} {x₂ : sort₂}
         →   form source expression:  x₁ · x₂
           ⇒ form target expression: map₁ x₂ ·′ map₂ x₂
           ⇒ equate them using target sort's map:  map₂ (x₁ · x₂) ≡ map₁ x₂ ·′ map₂ x₂
    :End:

    First, we need a helper that forms the preservation formulae.
    For example:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp  :tangle no
(show-element (homify (make-element :name "_·_" :type "Scalar → Vector → Vector")
                      '( ("Scalar" . 4) ("Vector" . 1))))
⇒
  pres-· : {x₄ : Scalar} → {x₁ : Vector}
         → map₁ (_·_ x₄ x₁)   ≡   _·′_ (map₄ x₄) (map₁ x₁)
#+END_SRC

    With this as a specification, in a ~lisp~ block:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle "variationals.tmp" :noweb yes :noweb-ref std-𝒱-lib
(defun homify (element sort)
  "Given a typed name, produce the associating “preservation” formula.

  (letf* ((sorts     (mapcar #'car sort))

  This is so cool (•̀ᴗ•́)و

  We leave it to the reader to derive other constructs from a theory presentation.
  Examples can be found in these [[https://alhassy.github.io/next-700-module-systems/papers/JC_Program_Generation_Talk_IFIP.pdf][Metaprogramming Agda]] slides:
  Homomorphism equality, application to carrier elements, isomorphisms,
  isomorphisms where only one direction needs to preserve the structure
  and an automatically derivable proof that the other direction is also
  structure preserving, endomorphism and automorphism types, kernels,
  product & sum & other categorical types.

  + Challenge ::
      Design a scheme to produce simple Cartesian products from a given theory.

    1. The only variable to this problem is an arbitrary record, say it is ~M~.

       For this exercise to be tractable, assume ~M~ consists of declarations
       of sort symbols, function symbols, and nullary (non-implication) equations
       which may have implicit arguments.

    2. Ensure you understood the definition of the homomorphism scheme above.
    3. Mimic the homomorphism scheme to produce a typed ~Prod~ where ~Prod A₀ A₁~
       consists of a ~M~ value, say ~P~, and two homomorphisms ~Hom P Aᵢ~.
    4. Write a Lisp code that produces a function ~MakeProduct : (A₀ A₁ : M) → Prod A₀ A₁~.

       - The projection morphisms are straightforward.
       - Every /n/-ary function ~f~ could be defined by ~fₚ = zipₙ f₀ f₁~.
       - Every equation ~e~ could be defined by ~eₚ = cong₂ _,_ e₀ e₁~.

    5. If you have actually attempted this, then go on to include the remaining
       artefacts to make the construction an actual categorical product.

Suppose you're a Haskell programmer and want to have multiple monoid instances for the Booleans.
You may make isomorphic copies of the Booleans, say ~And~ and ~Any~, and implement the desired instance
for each. What about if you want a Monoid instance but insist only that the unit be ~false~, what do you do then?

With this prototype, you expose the carrier and the operation in the first case, and expose the identity in the second case.
Moreover, you only write the definition of monoid once, leading to our motto:
#+BEGIN_CENTER
/Write once, derive many!/
#+END_CENTER

Here's a formalisation of monoids:
#+NAME: monoid
#+BEGIN_SRC agda :results replace :wrap "src results-agda"
PackageFormer Monoid : Set₁ where
    Carrier : Set
    _⨾_     : Carrier → Carrier → Carrier
    Id      : Carrier
    assoc   : ∀ {x y z} → (x ⨾ y) ⨾ z ≡ x ⨾ (y ⨾ z)
    leftId  : ∀ {x : Carrier} → Id ⨾ x ≡ x
    rightId : ∀ {x : Carrier} → x ⨾ Id ≡ x
#+END_SRC
:Hide:
#+RESULTS: monoid
#+BEGIN_src results-agda
PackageFormer Monoid : Set₁ where
    Carrier : Set
    _⨾_     : Carrier → Carrier → Carrier
    Id      : Carrier
    assoc   : ∀ {x y z} → (x ⨾ y) ⨾ z ≡ x ⨾ (y ⨾ z)
    leftId  : ∀ {x : Carrier} → Id ⨾ x ≡ x
    rightId : ∀ {x : Carrier} → x ⨾ Id ≡ x
#+END_src
:End:

We regain the Haskell-style typeclass definition with the following declaration:
#+BEGIN_SRC agda
 Monoid-Classical = Monoid typeclass :height (1) :level (dec)
#+END_SRC
Loading the script, with ~C-c C-l~ as usual, produces a generated file that elaborate this definition as follows:
#+BEGIN_SRC results-agda
record Monoid-Classical (Carrier : Set) : Set where
  field
    _⨾_     : Carrier → Carrier → Carrier
    Id      : Carrier
    assoc   : ∀ {x y z} → (x ⨾ y) ⨾ z ≡ x ⨾ (y ⨾ z)
    leftId  : ∀ {x : Carrier} → Id ⨾ x ≡ x
    rightId : ∀ {x : Carrier} → x ⨾ Id ≡ x
#+END_SRC
Notice that a name ~Carrier~ has been lifted to being a parameter instead of a field.
This is the result of the ~:height~ argument to the ~typeclass~ variational defined
in the previous subsection.

:TODO_FIXME:
We could use the letter ~m~ in-place of ~Carrier~, as is done in Haskell, as follows.
#+BEGIN_SRC agda
 Monoid-m = Monoid typeclass renaming (Carrier to m)
#+END_SRC
Which propagates ~Carrier = m~ into the fields. The propagation is necessary
if we were, for example, to rename ~_⨾_ to _⊕_~ ---otherwise we would need to parse
mixfix applications of this operator, as in ~assoc~!
#+BEGIN_SRC agda
record Monoid-m (m : Set) : Set where
  field
    _⨾_     : let Carrier = m in m → m → m
    Id      : let Carrier = m in m
    assoc   : let Carrier = m in ∀ {x y z} → (x ⨾ y) ⨾ z ≡ x ⨾ (y ⨾ z)
    leftId  : let Carrier = m in ∀ {x : let Carrier = m in m} → Id ⨾ x ≡ x
    rightId : let Carrier = m in ∀ {x : let Carrier = m in m} → x ⨾ Id ≡ x
#+END_SRC
:END:

Since Agda supports ‘named instances’, the Haskeller's first problem is solved. However, we demonstrate
an alternative solution that will allow us to solve the second problem in a fashion that current Agda
can only awkwardly approximate.

For example, with the current setup, we may go about requesting multiple monoid instances for the Booleans:
#+BEGIN_SRC agda
open Monoid-Classical using () renaming (_⨾_ to Op)

yuck-one :  (X Y : Classical 𝔹)
     →  Op X  ≡ _∧_  →  Op Y  ≡ _∨_
     →  Set
yuck-one = ???
#+END_SRC

The following declaration lets us ‘uncurry’ the first ~N = 2~ elements
from the field-position to the parameter-position.
#+BEGIN_SRC agda
MonoidOp = Monoid typeclass :height (2) :level (dec)
#+END_SRC

This then yields:
#+BEGIN_src results-agda
record MonoidOp (Carrier : Set) (_⨾_ : Carrier → Carrier → Carrier) : Set where
  field
    Id      : Carrier
    assoc   : ∀ {x y z} → (x ⨾ y) ⨾ z ≡ x ⨾ (y ⨾ z)
    leftId  : ∀ {x : Carrier} → Id ⨾ x ≡ x
    rightId : ∀ {x : Carrier} → x ⨾ Id ≡ x
#+END_src

Which let's us solve the first problem elegantly as so:
#+BEGIN_SRC agda
first-problem : MonoidOp 𝔹 _∧_  →  MonoidOp 𝔹 _∨_  → Set
first-problem = ???
#+END_SRC

Neato ^_^ Short and sweet.

Now for the second problem. Rather than forming a new data-type,
we hoist up the ~Id~-entity field as a parameter.
| ~TODO: Write this section~ |

#+BEGIN_SRC agda
 MonoidId = Monoid record exposing (Carrier; Id)
#+END_SRC
Which results in:
#+BEGIN_SRC agda
record MonoidId (Carrier : Set) (Id : Carrier) : Set where
  field
    _⨾_     : Carrier → Carrier → Carrier
    assoc   : ∀ {x y z} → (x ⨾ y) ⨾ z ≡ x ⨾ (y ⨾ z)
    leftId  : ∀ {x : Carrier} → Id ⨾ x ≡ x
    rightId : ∀ {x : Carrier} → x ⨾ Id ≡ x
#+END_SRC

Resulting in the solution type:
#+BEGIN_SRC agda
second-problem-okay : (X Y : MonoidId 𝔹 false) → Set
second-problem-okay = ???
#+END_SRC
However, this too can get tedious if we wish to only consider monoids
with unit ~false~. In that case, we /treat/ the fields as if they where
manifest fields and instantiate them to form a new type.
#+BEGIN_SRC agda
{-700 Monoid-false = Monoid record with (Carrier to 𝔹; Id to false) -}

record Monoid-false : Set where
  field
    _⨾_     : 𝔹 → 𝔹 → 𝔹
    assoc   : ∀ {x y z} → (x ⨾ y) ⨾ z ≡ x ⨾ (y ⨾ z)
    leftfalse  : ∀ {x : 𝔹} → false ⨾ x ≡ x
    rightfalse : ∀ {x : 𝔹} → x ⨾ false ≡ x

1. A <<<context>>> Γ is an association list, for us they consist of name-type pairs
   where later types may depend on the names of previous types:

         Γ = (x₀ : τ₀; …; xₙ : τₙ) is well-formed
     iff (x₀ : τ₀; …; xₖ₋₁ : τₖ₋₁) ⊢ τₖ Type

2. A <<<morphism>>> of contexts $σ : Γ → Δ$ is an assignment $Γ-names → Δ-terms$
   such that $Δ ⊢ σ xᵢ : σᵉ τᵢ$ where σᵉ is the homomorphic extension to types.

   For example, Γ = (A : Type; B : Type; q : A × B)
                Δ = (C : Type; p : C × C)
                σ = {A ↦ C; B → C; q ↦ p}

   Then, Δ ⊢ σ q ∶ σᵉ (A × B)
       ⇔ Δ ⊢ p ∶ σᵉ A × σᵉ B
       ⇔ Δ ⊢ p ∶ C × C
       ⇔ true

3. We have a category of contexts ℂ.

4. The subcategory of nominal assignments 𝔹 has only those morphisms whose terms
   are names; i.e., morphisms that are name-to-name assignments.

   - An <<<extension>>> is a nominal assignment where every name occurs
     at most once; these encode subcontext embeddings.
   - A <<<rename>>> is a nominal isomorphism.
   - Since renames and extensions are both nominals, their composition is also a nominal.

   Interestingly, nominal morphisms are essentially renames followed by extensions.

   Since we allow named constants, usual, possibly non-nominal, morphisms are essentially
   renames that send symbols to fresh constant symbols whose definitions denote the term in
   the orginal view, then we follow that by a rewrite and drop of these constant names.

5. Let 𝔼 denote the category of extensions: Objects are extension morphisms
   and arrows are two 𝔹-arrows that make the resulting square commute.

Since our prototype is intended to be as minimally obtrusive as possible, we will
need to extract our special 700-syntactical items between delimited tokens
and process them.

The following subsections introduce:
+ ~get-children~ :: Obtaining intended items from a hierarchical listing.
+ ~sub-string-delimited-here~ :: Finding the shortest substring between a prefix
      ~𝑳~ and a postfix ~𝑹~ by using the ‘metavariable’ ~$here~; e.g., ~“𝑳 $here 𝑹”.~
+ ~buffer-substring-delimited-whole-buffer~ :: Yield all portions of the
     buffer enclosed in the given delimiters, as a list of strings.
+ ~rename-mixfix~ :: Renamaing Agda mixifix names where the rename operation
     ignores the outermost (Agda) argument position markers ‘_’.
+ ~extract-imports~ :: Obtain all ‘import’ clauses so that they can be
     ported over to the generated file.

First we include an Emacs Lisp [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Library-Headers.html#Library-Headers][library header]] which declares important meta-data
---with the aim of having the resulting software
be distributed with Emacs's largest package repository, MELPA.
Installing this package, from within Emacs, also automatically installs its dependencies,

;; For example, the decision of whether a record element should be
;; declared as a field or as a parameter no longer needs to be performed
;; prematurely but rather may be selected when necessary.

;; We cannot use lexical binding since the package provides a macro called 𝒱
;; that acts as an interface for a DSL that generates Lisp functions
;; which requires EVAL to bind staged formal arguments to their runtime values.

;; This el file has been tangled from a literate, org-mode, file.

We would think that ~item 1~ has two ‘children’, and, moreover, one grand-child.
Whereas ~item 2~ has a single child and ~item 3~ is barren.

Here's my intuitive algorithm: We obtain the indentation of the first child,
then all subsequent lines with at least that much indentation have the same ancestor.

#+NAME: get-children
Go into ‘the-wild’ seeking out the first occurence of ‘parent’,

#+NAME: get-children
“Minimal” in that if there are items with a greater indentation,
then they are children of children and should be kept.

#+NAME: get-children
The first input argument is of type ‘string’,
the second argument may be of type ‘string’ or ‘list’ of strings
---if it's a string, we split along new lines---,
the optional ‘then’ is a function acting on children strings.

#+NAME: get-children
Result is the parent followed by its children, as a list of lines,
where each child has been altered using the optional THEN function.
Moreover, we also return the rest of the unconsidered portion of THE-WILD:

The first element is the porition that does not contain an occurence
of PARENT.  The second is the parent and its children, if possible.
The third is the remainder of THE-WILD.

first child, then use that as a lower bound to find the indentation
of the remaining children.

Let's try this out on our example hierarchy, ~eh~, from earlier.

#+END_SRC

(pf--load-package-former (cadr (pf--get-children "PackageFormer"
"PackageFormer Test : Set₁ where
PackageFormer Another : Set₁ where
")))

Excellent! Let's looks at the other parents.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var eh = children-example :exports both :results table replace
(pf--get-children "+ item 2" eh)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

Notice that we found the parent ~+ item 2~ and its only child ~- subitem 1.2~, and
we kept the prefix of ~eh~ that did not contain the parent as well as
the remaining unconsidered portion of ~eh~. ---Moreover, it looks like we obtained
the transpose of the example hierarchy 😛

Finally, the barren parents.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var eh = children-example :exports both :results table replace
(pf--get-children "+ item 0" eh)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| + item 0 |               |                    |               |          |               |          |

As well as,
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var eh = children-example :exports both :results table replace

Everything before it is considered the prefix. Yay :smile:

Before we move on, let's try altering a child clause; e.g., I'd like
~* subitem 1.1.1~ to be renamed to ~* subitem that is super deep~.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var eh = children-example :exports both :results table replace
(cadr (pf--get-children "+ item 1" eh
 :then (lambda (x) (s-replace "1.1.1" "that is super deep" x))))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| + item 1 | - subitem 1.1 | * subsubitem that is super deep | - subitem 1.2 |

Nice :grin:

Now the moment of truth, let's try this out on our example.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var test = test :exports both :results table replace :wrap "src results-agda"
(cadr (pf--get-children "PackageFormer" test))
#+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:

#+end_src

Also, does the list variant work:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var test = test :exports both :results replace  :wrap "src results-agda"
(cadr (pf--get-children "PackageFormer" (s-lines test)))
#+END_SRC

however for maintenance it is ideal to include unit tests that can

For this prototype's constraints, a PackageFormer will generally declared as
#+BEGIN_SRC agda :tangle no
PackageFormer Name : Set level where
     ⋮
#+END_SRC

The body, ~⋮~, of such a declaration consists of a number of name-type declarations
and, equations ---*not yet supported*--- so let's form a type to work with these
components rather than meddle with strings all the time.

#+name: package-former
- ‘docstring’: Relevant documentation about this structure; e.g.,
   what is the instance declaration that generated this type, if any.

- ‘kind’: PackageFormer, record, data, module, function, etc.

- ‘name’: The name of the grouping mechanism schema.

- ‘level’: The universe level that the instantiations will inhabit.
       The universe level of the PackageFormer.

- Finally, the children fields are the typed-names that constitute the body of the
  grouping mechanism. As long as consistent indentation is selected, it does not matter how much.
  As such, we keep track of these indentation numerics ourselves in case we need to tweak them.

- The first ‘waist’-many elements are considered parameters.

TODO: Eventually need to support variations?

( Lisp convention would advise this function to be named ~with-pf~, but I'm using the prefix ~open~,
as it is closer to the object language, Agda. )

  It is crucial to realise that we have just established a convention
  that partitions the elements of a PackageFormer:
  + <<<parameters>>> are the elements before the waist line.
  + <<<fields>>> are the elements after the waist line.

  Variationals are refieid as functions with the prefix 𝒱-;
  doing otherwise may override existing utilities in Emacs
  ---for example, ‘record’ is a useful name for a variational
  but is a super important utility function in Emacs.
  The apporach we take is to allow users to write ‘record’
  but the implementation will refer to it with a prefix.

Parsing variational clauses is then straightforward:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no

#+name: 𝒱𝒸
- If there is a ‘label’, then yield ‘(label :key value ⋯)’
  since ‘label’ is assumed to exist as a variational having the given
  keys as arguments.  The result should be a list of pairs.

  BODY-LIST consists of elements of this shape.

- If there is no label, the parse the list of pairs.

- For example,

    (cl-defun 𝒱-test (&key height kind) (list (format "%s & %s" height kind)))

    (𝒱𝒸 '(test :height 3 :kind 'data)) ≈ (test :height 3 :kind data) ≈ (“3 & data”)

    (𝒱𝒸 '(     :height 3 :kind data))  ≈ ((:height . 3) (:kind . data))

- Newer items c₀ ⟴ ⋯ ⟴ cₙ should be at the front of the list;
  access should then be using ‘assoc’.

- CONTEXT is the parent context that contains an invocation of this method.

- ARGS is the list of names that are bound, and so are variational args.

- The result is a function NAME prefixed by 𝒱- whose BODY is an alist
  obtained from the aforementioned key-value pairs.

- E.g., (𝒱 tes positional (keyword 3) = :kind data)
  This defines a variational with one positional and one keyword argument having
  3 as default.

- The resulting generated function has its code embeded as a docstring viewable
  with “𝑪-𝒉 𝒐” ---catented after any provided user documentation.

* Loading an Agda Buffer
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: Loading-an-Agda-Buffer
  :END:

# Herein we define the datatype of ~instance-declaration~, describe how
# to parse such entities.

Before we can parse an Agda buffer, we need to be able to parse an instantiation declaration;
for which we would later generate code.

** Loading an Instance ---The Core Utility
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: Loading-an-Instance----The-Core-Utility
   :END:
An instance declaration is of the form:
#+BEGIN_SRC results-agda
PF′ = PF variational₁ args₁ ⟴  ⋯ ⟴ variationalₙ (argsₙ)
#+END_SRC

This gives rise to a simple nice structure:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle agda-next-700-module-systems.el
(defstruct pf-instance-declaration
  "Record of components for an PackageFormer instance declaration:
   ⟪name⟫ = ⟪package-former⟫ (⟴ ⟪variation⟫ [⟪args⟫])*
  "

  docstring      ;; What the declaration looks like, useful for reference.
  name           ;; Left-hand side
  package-former ;; Parent grouping mechanism
  alterations    ;; List of variationals along with their arguments.
)
#+END_SRC

Loading an instantiation into our list is now trivial.

#+name:load-instance-declaration
- If the current LINE string is an instance declaration,
  then produce a new PackageFormer from it.  Else, do nothing.

- Whitespace is automatically collopased from LINE.

- Nil elements are discarded; e.g., due to a filter.

- Duplicates are discarded; e.g., due to a rename.

- Variational clauses may mention
  + $𝑛𝑎𝑚𝑒: The name of the PackageFormer currently being declared;
            i.e., the LHS name.
  + $𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠: Many variationals will act on individal elements, but may check a
           property relative to all elements and this name allows us to avoid
           having variationals that simply accomodate for binary functions
           that operate on an individual element while also needing to refer to
           all elements.  For example, a variational that keeps an element if
           it's related to another element somehow.

- SHOW-IT: For testing, and presentation, this optional value indicates whether
  the resulting PackageFormer should be pretty-printed or not.

   We already two global lists ---for our loaded PackageFormers and varitionals
   declarared--- we need two additional globals: One for the contents of 700-comments,
   primarily for basic efficiency, and the other to port whatever is within
   700-comments but is not 700-syntax. The latter is for when we want definitions
   or generalised variables to be accessible in /both/ 700-comments and the
   surrounding script. Which is achieved since the matter is exported to
   the generated file in the Elisp stage, then imported at the Agda level.

   However, since content to be ported may occur between PackageFormer definitions
   and instance declarations, we need to remember the position of items that are ported.
   The simplest thing to do is simply place items for porting into the package-formers
   list ---then take care to check if an item is for porting or not when printing
   PackageFormers to a generated file.

   It gets rather tedious to jump to the generated files to see the elaborations
   of 700-syntactical items. As such, let's tie existing occurrences of a PackageFormer's
   name to its elaboration.

   #+name: tooltipify
   We only add tooltips to PHRASE as a standalone word, not as a subword.

   The PHRASE is taken literally; no regexp operators are recognised.

   Useful info on tooltips:
    + http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/blog/2013/04/12/Tool-tips-on-text-in-Emacs/

    + https://stackoverflow.com/questions/293853/defining-new-tooltips-in-emacs

  The second resource above shows how to alter the phrase's font to indicate that it has
  a tooltip. It is not desirable for us, since we want to add onto Agda's colouring.

 Personal note:
 Using ~(write-file "Generated.agda")~ means we make a file
 then the temporary buffer /visits/ the Agda file, which loads the
 Agda process therein, which is undesirable since it could leave
 Agda working on the buffer even after it has been killed!
 + This would necessiate calling ~(agda2-restart)~ afterwards.
 + Instead we write the whole region, without visiting the resuting file.

   :CUSTOM_ID: Features-Wish-list
   :END:

We check them off, rather than deleting them,
to produce a ‘tada’ list of features ;-)

:Changelog:

➩ NEW, Pushout construction!

  𝒱-union forms pushouts in the category of signatures ^_^

  My implementation solves some of TPC paper's issues regarding the number of inputs: I use optional inputs
  and defaults otherwise. I'm also using input function f,g in the reverse direction ---I haven't seen this
  before, but it works lol

➩ NEW, Pullback construction ^_^

  This is much harder to do than pushout; but shares the same ideas for reducing the number of input arguments.

➩ “to”-lists can now be interpreted bijectively!

   𝒱-renaming now has an optional parameter “:adjoin-coretract” to form
   the other half of the bijection. Unlike “:adjoin-retract”, it's off by default.

➩ Add remarks on commutativity of combinators in user manual section on renaming.

➩ NEW variational, “postulating”.

    This was mentioned in an in-discussion exercise in the user manual.
    The solution to the exercise has been formalised and has a section in the user manual.

    It serves as an accessible example of extending the system by users.

➩ Redirected extraction of 𝒱ariationals defined in the first part of the user manual
  via reference 𝒱-user-man-pt-1.

  Since they relied on the variationals defined in part 2, they caused an error during compilation.

➩ Fixed indentation issue; using at least 4 spaces in elaborated code.

➩ Support crazy names, like [],+,\,^,*,?

➩ Experimented with having anonymous PackageFormers.

➩ Made support-for-mixfix names off by default.

➩ Added adjoin-retract option to 𝒱-extended-by.

➩ Fixed tooltip calculation to account for regular expression operators, such as [],+,\,^,*,?.

➩ NEW, 𝒱-PackageFormer

  variational to mark a grouping mechanism as abstract, so that it is NOT elaborated into concrete Agda.
:End:

+ [X] For now, arguments must be enclosed in parenthesis.
   - [X] This is likely to be dropped in a future edition of the system.

+ [X] Colouring for 700-syntactical items.

+ [X] Tooltips

+ [ ] Some menu items are a bit buggy ---this is low-priority.

+ [ ] MA: WK: hiding ↦ dropping

+ [ ] Use pf--buffer-substring-delimited-whole-buffer to parse /multiple/
      pf--annotations!

+ [ ] Add a level component to an instance structure; reduce it if Carrier is a parameter and otherwise leave it alone.
      Instead, let the level of a PackageFormer denote the level of the typeclass instantiation, then with this in mind
      we increase the level component of an instance structure only for those variations that keep the carrier as a field.
      When we move to multi-sorted, as in Graphs, this issue will need to be revisited.

+ [X] Currently can only perform simple variational clauses; need to support complex clauses.

+ [X] Support for equations in PackageFormers: Easy, nothing new needed! Thank-you ~alter-elements~!

+ [X]   Examples from the user-manual
        should be exported into an Agda file which is then easily checked;
        or the resulting generated code should be generated when export happens.

+ [ ] We can only perform “LHS = PF 𝓋𝒸”, do we also want stand-alone “PF 𝓋𝒸”?
  - Maybe not? Maybe it suffices to use, say, “_ = PF 𝓋𝒸”?

  # TODO: Give an example making use of suffix-fields to ‘extend’ a packageformer with new fields. E.g., PackageFormer B = A extended-by cs ought to be valid but so should I = A vs extended-by cs which is amicable syntax for the instantation (A extended-by cs) vs. Should this automatically yield forgetful coercisions “I⇒A”? For now, maybe yes by default and no if we use, say, fields instead of extended-by. There will be issues of coherency when we add items.

+ [X] Need to implement a *front-end* system to extend variational clauses.

+ [ ] The ~elements~ of a PackageFormer should be  an alist, ~'(name . type)~.
  - Maybe not, the front-end lets users treat them as strings, easily.
  - Maybe such a view is useful for the user? It is provided via ~get-name~ and ~get-type~.

+ [X] Refactor load-instantions function to make use of an ~alter~ field rather than overloading alter-fields in reify-instances.

+ [X] Refactor ~instantiate~ to make use of an ~instance~ structure, rather than 13 arguments.
  - In my defence, 13 arguments was because I was trying to find out what were the key ingredients
    necessary to form different variational presentations. It seems I only needed 5 ^_^

+ [ ] Why does ‘pf--buffer-substring-delimited-whole-buffer’ return a list of strings? Why not join its result to simply return a list?

+ [X] Generated.agda needs to inherit all open/import declarations from parent.

+ [ ] Give an example PackageFormer with some definitions or derived constructs, then hoist-up your waist so that the non-defined items are ~module~ parameters.

+ [X] PF's should account for equations. For simplicity they become components of a record & module, but derived operations on datatypes.

+ [ ] Demonstrate how generative modules can be emulated.

+ [ ] The global variables package-formers & instance-declaration should be /buffer/ specific?

+ [X] Assign to a local var, check equality against global pf--annotations,
      if identical, no more processing since everything already generated.

+ [ ] Make use of docstring so that when a user enters a key sequence or selects from a menu, we can show them a listing of all ‘major’ components of a program: An org-mode file is displayed with an enumeration of the items, each being a link to the source, and only their docstring is shown. This is a nice ‘overview’ of the program source.

+ [X] Currently it looks like we are a minor mode, but this is not true. We only have a menu and the icon (•̀ᴗ•́)و is displayed when our feature is supported.
  - Now a minor mode.

+ [ ] Generate all instances of a PackageFormer schema.

+ ~MR = M-Set primed~ crashes!

+ [ ] Look into [[https://github.com/KestrelInstitute/Specware][*Specware*]].

  - Structures are created using colimits.
  - Are hierarchical considerations leaked by the resulting structures?

+ [X] PackageFormer.ext ↦ package-former.ext

    ⇨ kebab-case is conventional of Lisp
+ [X] Arguments, in tooltip renditions, are in reverse order; c.f. 𝒱-open.

       This is because 𝒱 lists them in the wrong order!
+ [X] colouring should be whole words only; see tooltipify
+ [X] Improved concept of PackageFormer constituents

  Element  ≈  [qualifier] [lhs] [:] [type] [list-of definitional clauses]

  Eqn      ≈  [same-lhs-as-before] [args] ≈ [term]
+ [X] extensions of structures can be formed;
+ [X] Form sum of two PackageFormers!
+ [X] Form library of common or useful variations or combinators, using the meta-primitives.
  - renaming :: Given a function f, apply it to all names.
  - map-elements f :: Apply function f to each element.
  - prefix-elements :: Given a list of new elements, prepend them to the current list of elements.
  - postfix-elements :: Given a list of new elements, postpend them to the current list of elements.
  - drop-elements :: Given a predicate, drop the fields that satisfy it.
    - Moreover, drop additional fields if they depend on dropped fields? (maybe).
  - opening f :: Module renaming according to f.
  - manifest :: Mention one form; briefly mention others.

  Note that package formation has been liberated from the backend and brought to the user
  via our 5 meta-primitives: preamble, kind, waist, waist-strings, level, alter-elements.
+ [X] Allow “:level” to be ‘inc, dec, omit’ where the last option omits the “: Set ℓ” declaration altogether.
  - Useful for module setups.
+ [X] Make a “raw” variation that allows meta-primitives to be invoked whenever.
  - Maybe called 𝓌𝒾𝓉𝒽 ?
    ➱ Look at load variations, if there are any 𝓌𝒾𝓉𝒽 clauses, then add them to the
       variation's pairs. assoc ensures only latest items are picked up and so
       these would overwrite whatever the variation wanted; neato.
       Perhaps check that 𝓌𝒾𝓉𝒽 clauses only allow meta-primitives?

       - This is accomplished by a combination of a meta-primitive followed by “⟴”.
       - Unless needed otherwise, this is a non-issue.

** PackageFormers with variational parameters
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: PackageFormers-with-variational-parameters
   :END:

    + [ ] For now, PackageFormer's have no other parameters besides the variation symbol ---not even that atm.

 Allow package formers to have explicit ~Variation~ parameters; but
       how do we then deal with nested invocations? What are the uses of
       having differing invocations?

       For example,
       #+BEGIN_SRC agda
PackageFormer LawfullyPointed (v : Variation) : Set where
   point : LawfullyPointed v
   law   : LawfullyPointed FOL {- Concrete variation -}

                          #+END_SRC
       Would elaborate to something like:
       #+BEGIN_SRC agda
       data LP-Term (Vars : Set) : Set where
        {- Abstract fields from constituents of packageformer -}
        Point    : LP-Term
        {- Fragment of first order logic term formation -}
        _′       : Vars → LP-Term {- Injection of vars as terms -}
        _≈_      : LP-Term → LP-Term → LP-Term
        ∀′ ∃′    : (Vars → LP-Term) → LP-Term

       record LP : Set₁ where
     constructor _,_,_
     field
        Carrier : Set
        point   : Carrier
        law     : LP-Term Carrier
 #+END_SRC

       With the following example uses.
       #+BEGIN_SRC agda
      Contractable : (A : Set) (a : A) → LP
      Contractable A a =  A , a , ∀′ (λ x → x ≈ a ′)

      Indistinguishable : (A : Set)  →  LP hiding point
      Indistinguishable A a =  A , ∀′ (λ x → ∀′ (λ y → x ≈ y))
       #+END_SRC
       Where ~PF hiding c~ is the largest sub-PackageFormer of ~PF~ with constituent ~c~
       removed ---in particular, constituents that depend on ~c~ would also be dropped.

   Some properties are merely the syntactic mirror of other
   ---it would make sense to have this relationship explicit.
   For example:
   + Left units/zeros/distributively are mirrors of the right ones.
     - http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~nad/listings/lib/Algebra.FunctionProperties.html#1
     - Additionally, in the presence of commutativity, such mirrored definitions are provably identically.

   With duality, we can even derive more structure!    For example,
   + Join semilattices are dual to meet semilattices.
   + As such, /position/ of the operators is symmetric wrt the definition of a join-&-meet lattice.

** COMMENT DONE Extensions
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: Extensions
   :END:
   Mathematical structures naturally come in related hierarchies.
   Agda users' current solution is to manually declare such relationships
   by means of conversion functions. An extension *variational* could be formed
   to make this process mechanical ---using tiny theories.
   + Examples: http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~nad/listings/lib/Algebra.html#2533
     - C.f., every abelian group /is a/ group.

   *Theory graphs:*
   Incidentally, as it stands, the current prototype allows arbitrary Emacs Lisp to be
   used and so such a variational could potentially produce ~dot~ specifications
   in the current directory, which can be used to obtain *visually* the relationships
   between structures. Such “mathematical knowledge management” is underway with the MMT setup.

   + [ ] ~B = cs ⟨+ A ⟨+ cs′~ where each cs is a single name-type declaration and the operation is left-associative, and A is an existing packageformer. This gives us a nice way to build a hierarchy. Note that since only A has a name, we may form a forgetful coercion B⇒A automatically.
  E.g., ~Monoid = Type ⟨+ Pointed ⟨+ (Magma renaming (_⊕_ to _⨾_)) ⟨+ LeftUnital ⟨+ RightUnital ⟨+ assoc : ∀ {x y z} → (x ⨾ y) ⨾ z ≡ x ⨾ (y ⨾ z)~ gives, automatically, ~Monoid⇒Type, Monoid⇒Pointed, Monoid⇒Magma, Monoid⇒LeftUnital, Magma⇒RightUnital~ (•̀ᴗ•́)و MA: To begin with, ignore the rename and work up the sequence one ⟨+ at a time.

   + Theory Presentation Combinators [cite:tpc]

     This work aims to provide a sound categorical basis for most of the combinators
     in section 2 above, in-particular: Extensions, renames, and pushouts.
     The work emphasises the importance of these combinators at the PackageFormer
     level but also at the level of morphisms between them ---which is not something
     we are even considering.

   + [[https://github.com/ysharoda/PhD-Proposal/blob/master/proposal.pdf][Leveraging the information contained in theory presentations]] (PhD Proposal)

     This work focuses on /library combinators that give free common constructions/
     such as deriving the type of homomorphisms from a given PackageFormer.
     We have shown this particular example, in section 2 of the user manual, to
     demonstrate how our low-level setup can be used in the creation of such
     combinators.

     *We provide a low-level kernel which supports the creation of such combinators, but we are not studying such combinators, their use, their classifications, nor their theory.*

   + A Scalable Module System [link]
     # cite:mmt_main_paper

     An impressive work, the MMT language ---a module system for mathematical theories---
     may serve as a standardised representation format for a formal,
     web-scalable, digital
     library that supports mathematical knowledge management ‘in the large’.
     The resulting system is not only logic-independent but also foundation-independent;
     unlike [cite:tpc], it shifts semantic concerns to concrete instances but
     allows more than first-class morphisms between contexts, going up to morphisms
     between logics.

     *Whereas one focus of this work is the developement of a standardised format and library of mathematical knowledge management, our aims are more humble: An extensible and mouldable module system for programmers via a kernel of meta-primitives.*

      case and is converted into a legitimate Lisp function.

      No label results in to-list becoming a dotted list.

      If “no-to” is true, then we do not parse the to-clauses, yielding
      a list of strings.

      Errors on an empty list. Yields nil if the label is not found.
      Note that n = 0 is fine, provided the otherwise clause
      is present.
