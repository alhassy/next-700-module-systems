Title: Do-it-yourself Module Systems: Unbundling on the fly and mechanically
obtaining termtypes from theories

Terse Abstract: We show how a bit of reflection can be used to achieve on the
fly unbundling to lift record fields to the type level as parameters, and we use
monadic do-notation to make the resulting setup practical and pragmatic for
experimentation. It is well known in the folklore that record types are contexts
(i.e., sequences of name-type pairs), we go on to show that termtypes (GADTs)
are also contexts. Moreover, since records and termtypes are both contexts, we
show how to derive the latter from the former *mechanically* via a macro; e.g., we
mechanically ask for the termtype of dynamic systems, monoids, pointed sets,
collections and find the results to be that of the natural numbers, tree
skeletons, the maybe type, and the list type.  Surprisingly, the entire
development is under 300 lines of Agda.

:Remarks:
+ live demo instead of video, quality was poor. ლ(ಠ益ಠ)

+ Give concrete examples.

+ Skip slides like toc and slides you ignore.
  - or, during the toc slide, set the stage
    for what's coming up.

    Give a background on the problem, quickly.

+ Don't stand in front of the slides. ─use the laser pointer‼

+ Use the NOTES to make speaker notes.

+ Say what is the approach I'm using to ensure that the problem is feasible.
  - Communicate that its doable and that I can do it.

+ Dicuss how even going to attempt doing this, the research

1. catchy subtitle: reptition means we're doing something wrong.

   A language has many languages, whence repetitive.

   Maybe show a proof or something that
   shows a DTL making use of the first
   five pieces together. ;-)
   Show the problem.

+ make it clear what I'm doing in 2 sentences:
  Providing primitives that minimise repetition
  for manipulaiting grouping mechanisms,
  without the end-user utilising preprocessing.

:End:
:How_to_enable_PDF_print_capabiility:

1. Open your presentation with print-pdf included in the query string i.e. http://localhost:8000/?print-pdf. You can test this with revealjs.com?print-pdf.
   - If you want to include speaker notes in your export, you can append showNotes=true to the query string: http://localhost:8000/?print-pdf&showNotes=true
2. Open the in-browser print dialog (CTRL/CMD+P).
3. Change the Destination setting to Save as PDF.
4. Change the Layout to Landscape.
5. Change the Margins to None.
6. Enable the Background graphics option.
7. Click Save.

:End:
:FragmentStyles:
The ATTR_REVEAL part must be immediately preceding the first item in a list, no new line;
other items may be freely spaced.

Available fragment styles are:
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
    * grow
    * shrink
    * roll-in
    * fade-out
    * highlight-red
    * highlight-green
    * highlight-blue
    * appear

    Fragment sequence can be changed by assigning adding ~:frag_idx~
    property to each fragmented element.

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t :frag_idx 3
    And, this paragraph shows at last.

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t :frag_idx 2
    This paragraph shows secondly.

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t :frag_idx 1
    This paragraph shows at first.

~#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag frag-style~ above a list defines fragment style for the list as a whole.
To define fragment styles for every list item, please enumerate each item's style in a lisp list.

When there is :frag_idx specified, insufficient fragment style list will be extended by its last element. So a :frag (appear) assigns each item of a list the appear fragment style.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   * I appear.
   * I appear.
   * I appear.
#+END_SRC

Nb: Org-reveal supports /editable code blocks/ using klipsify.

  # :frag_idx (5 4 3 2 1)
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (grow shrink roll-in fade-out none)
+ I will grow.
+ I will shrink.
+ I rolled in.
+ I will fade out.
+ I don't fragment.

* COMMENT Configuration

** Set the location of Reveal.js

   Org-reveal must know where Reveal.js is on your computer before
   exporting Org contents. The location of Reveal.js is the path to
   the top directory of the Reveal.js packages, the directory which contains
   file *README.md*, but *not* the one that contains the file reveal.js.

   The default location is =./reveal.js=, relative to the Org file.

   Changing =org-reveal-root= 's value will change the location
   globally. For example, add the following statement to your .emacs
   file:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(setq org-reveal-root "file:///d:/reveal.js")
#+END_SRC
   *IMPORTANT*: the absolute path to Reveal.js should be in URL form,
   "file:///path_to_reveal.js", as illustrated above.  By setting
   option =REVEAL_ROOT=, the location is only affected within the Org
   file.

   #+BEGIN_SRC org
   ,#+REVEAL_ROOT: file:///d:/reveal.js
   #+END_SRC

   Set your =REVEAL_ROOT= to the following URL to download reveal.js from
   a CDN instead of downloading a local copy.

   #+BEGIN_SRC org
   ,#+REVEAL_ROOT: http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/reveal.js/3.0.0/
   #+END_SRC


*** Url form for file location

    For example if you cloned this repository to your home directory,
    this file in Mac OS X would be referred to as
    "file:///Users/username/org-reveal/readme.org".  This file in
    Ubuntu would be "file:///home/username/org-reveal/readme.org" and
    in Windows this file would be
    "file:///c:/Users/username/org-reveal/readme.org".  For more
    detail on this standard please refer to
    [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_URI_scheme]]

** First Try

   To load Org-reveal, type "M-x load-library", then type
   "ox-reveal".

   Now you can export this manual into Reveal.js presentation by
   typing "C-c C-e R R".

   Open the generated "Readme.html" in your browser and enjoy the
   cool slides.

** The HLevel

   Org-reveal maps each heading and its contents to one Reveal.js
   slide. Since Reveal.js arranges slides into a 2-dimensional matrix,
   Org-reveal use a *HLevel* value to decide whether to map headings to horizontal
   or vertical slides.

   * Headings of level less than or equal to *HLevel* are mapped to horizontal
     slides.
   * Headings with a deeper level are mapped to vertical slides.

   HLevel's default value is 1, means only level 1 headings are arranged
   horizontally. Deeper headings are mapped to vertical slides below their
   parent level 1 heading.

*** HLevel's Effects on Slides Layout

    Assume we have a simple Org file as below:
#+BEGIN_SRC org
,* H1
,* H2
,** H2.1
,*** H2.1.1
,* H3
#+END_SRC

    If HLevel is 1, the default value, headings H2.1 and H2.1.1 will
    be mapped to vertical slides below the slides of heading H2.

    [[./images/hlevel.png]]

    If HLevel is changed to 2, slides of heading H2.1 will be changed
    to the main horizontal queue, and slides of heading H2.1.1 will be
    a vertical slide below it.

    [[./images/hlevel2.png]]

*** Configure HLevel's Value

    * Change variable =org-reveal-hlevel='s value to set HLevel globally.\\
      For example, add the following statement to your =.emacs= file.
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(setq org-reveal-hlevel 2)
#+END_SRC

    * Setting Org files local HLevel to option =REVEAL_HLEVEL=.
#+BEGIN_SRC org
,#+REVEAL_HLEVEL: 2
#+END_SRC

** Force Split

   If one heading has too many things to fit into one slide, you can
   split the contents into multiple vertical slides manually, by inserting

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,#+REVEAL: split
#+END_SRC

#+REVEAL: split

   Now a new slide begins after =#+REVEAL= keyword.

** Select Theme and Transition

    Themes and transition styles are set globally throughout the whole
    file by setting options =REVEAL_THEME=, =REVEAL_TRANS=, and =REVEAL_SPEED=.

    For an example, please check the heading part of this document.

    Available themes can be found in "css/theme/" in the reveal.js directory.

    Available transitions are: default|cube|page|concave|zoom|linear|fade|none.
** Set The Title Slide
   By default, Org-reveal generates a title slide displaying the
   title, the author, the Email, the date and the time-stamp of the
   Org document, controlled by Org's [[http://orgmode.org/org.html#Export-settings][export settings]].

   To avoid a title slide, please set variable
   ~org-reveal-title-slide~ to ~nil~, or add ~reveal_title_slide:nil~ to
   ~#+OPTIONS:~ line.

   To restore the default title slide, please set variable
   ~org-reveal-title-slide~ to ~'auto~.

*** Customize the Title Slide

    To customize the title slide, please set ~org-reveal-title-slide~
    to a string of HTML markups. The following escaping character can
    be used to retrieve document information:
    | ~%t~ | Title     |
    | ~%a~ | Author    |
    | ~%e~ | Email     |
    | ~%d~ | Date      |
    | ~%%~ | Literal % |

** Set Slide Background

   Slide background can be set to a color, an image or a repeating image
   array by setting heading properties.

*** Single Colored Background
   :PROPERTIES:
   :reveal_background: #543210
   :END:

    Set property =reveal_background= to either an RGB color value, or any
    supported CSS color format.

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,*** Single Colored Background
   :PROPERTIES:
   :reveal_background: #123456
   :END:
#+END_SRC

*** Single Image Background
    :PROPERTIES:
    :reveal_background: ./images/whale.jpg
    :reveal_background_trans: slide
    :END:

    Set property =reveal_background= to an URL of background image.
    Set property =reveal_background_trans= to =slide= to make background image
    sliding rather than fading.
#+BEGIN_SRC org
,*** Single Image Background
    :PROPERTIES:
    :reveal_background: ./images/whale.jpg
    :reveal_background_trans: slide
    :END:
#+END_SRC

*** Repeating Image Background
    :PROPERTIES:
    :reveal_background: ./images/whale.jpg
    :reveal_background_size: 200px
    :reveal_background_repeat: repeat
    :END:

    Resize background image by setting property
    =reveal_background_size= to a number.

    Set property =reveal_background_repeat= to =repeat= to repeat
    image on the background.
#+BEGIN_SRC org
,*** Repeating Image Background
    :PROPERTIES:
    :reveal_background: ./images/whale.jpg
    :reveal_background_size: 200px
    :reveal_background_repeat: repeat
    :END:
#+END_SRC

*** Title Slide Background Image

    To set the title slide's background image, please specify the
    following options:

    * =REVEAL_TITLE_SLIDE_BACKGROUND=: A URL to the background image.
    * =REVEAL_TITLE_SLIDE_BACKGROUND_SIZE=: HTML size specification, e.g. ~200px~.
    * =REVEAL_TITLE_SLIDE_BACKGROUND_REPEAT=: set to ~repeat~ to repeat the image.

** Slide Size

   Reveal.js scales slides to best fit the display resolution, but you can
   also specify the desired size by settings the option tags =width= and =height=.

   The scaling behavior can also be constrained by setting following
   options:
   * =#+REVEAL_MARGIN:= :: a float number, the factor of empty area
    surrounding slide contents.
   * =#+REVEAL_MIN_SCALE:= :: a float number, the minimum scaling down
    ratio.
   * =#+REVEAL_MAX_SCALE:= :: a float number, the maximum scaling up
    ratio.

** Slide Numbering

   By default, a flatten slide number is showed at the lower-right corner of each slide.

   To disable slide numbering, please add ~reveal_slide_number:nil~ to
   ~#+OPTIONS:~ line.

   From Reveal.js 3.1.0, slide numbering can have several custom
   formats. To choose one format, please set ~reveal_slide_number~ to
   its proper string. For example, ~reveal_slide_number:h/v~.

   Supported format string can be found in [[https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/#slide-number][Reveal.js manual]].


** Slide Header/Footer
   Specify Slide header/footer by =#+REVEAL_SLIDE_HEADER:= and
   =#+REVEAL_SLIDE_FOOTER:=. The option content will be put into
   divisions of class =slide-header= and =slide-footer=, so you can
   control their appearance in custom CSS file(see [[Extra Stylesheets]]).
   By default header/footer content will only display on content
   slides. To show them also on the title and toc slide you can add
   ~reveal_global_header:t~ and ~reveal_global_footer:t~ to
   ~#+OPTIONS:~ line.

** Fragmented Contents

    Make contents fragmented (show up one-by-one) by setting option
    =ATTR_REVEAL= with property ":frag frag-style", as illustrated
    below.

    See here for examples of them: https://revealjs.com/#/fragments

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
    Paragraphs can be fragmented.

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
    - Lists can
    - be fragmented.

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
    Pictures, tables and many other HTML elements can be fragmented.

*** Fragment Styles
    Available fragment styles are:
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
    * grow
    * shrink
    * roll-in
    * fade-out
    * highlight-red
    * highlight-green
    * highlight-blue
    * appear

    Setting ~:frag t~ will use Reveal.js default fragment style, which
    can be overridden by local option ~#+REVEAL_DEFAULT_FRAG_STYLE~ or
    global variable ~org-reveal-default-frag-style~.

*** Fragment Index
    Fragment sequence can be changed by assigning adding ~:frag_idx~
    property to each fragmented element.

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t :frag_idx 3
    And, this paragraph shows at last.

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t :frag_idx 2
    This paragraph shows secondly.

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t :frag_idx 1
    This paragraph shows at first.

*** List Fragments

    ~#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag frag-style~ above a list defines fragment
    style for the list as a whole.
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag grow
    1. All items grow.
    2. As a whole.

    To define fragment styles for every list item, please enumerate
    each item's style in a lisp list.

    ~none~ in the style list will disable fragment for the
    corresponding list item.

    Custom fragment sequence should also be enumerated for each list
    item.

#+REVEAL: split
    An example:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (grow shrink roll-in fade-out none) :frag_idx (4 3 2 1 -)
   * I will grow.
   * I will shrink.
   * I rolled in.
   * I will fade out.
   * I don't fragment.
#+END_SRC

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (grow shrink roll-in fade-out none) :frag_idx (4 3 2 1 -)
   * I will grow.
   * I will shrink.
   * I rolled in.
   * I will fade out.
   * I don't fragment.
#+REVEAL: split
   When there is ~:frag_idx~ specified, insufficient fragment style
   list will be extended by its last element. So a ~:frag (appear)~
   assigns each item of a list the ~appear~ fragment style.
#+BEGIN_SRC org
,#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   * I appear.
   * I appear.
   * I appear.
#+END_SRC
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   * I appear.
   * I appear.
   * I appear.


** Data State
   :PROPERTIES:
   :reveal_data_state: alert
   :END:

   Set property =reveal_data_state= to headings to change this slide's
   display style, as illustrated above.

   Available data states are: alert|blackout|soothe.

** Plug-ins

   Reveal.js provides several plug-in functions.

   - reveal-control : Show/hide browsing control pad.
   - reveal-progress : Show/hide progress bar.
   - reveal-history : Enable/disable slide history track.
   - reveal-center : Enable/disable slide centering.
   - multiplex : Enable audience to view presentation on secondary devices.

*** Configure Plug-ins

    Each plugin can be toggled on/off by adding =#+OPTIONS= tags or
    by setting custom variables.

    - =#+OPTIONS= tags:\\
      =reveal_control=, =reveal_progress=, =reveal_history=,
      =reveal_center=, =reveal_rolling_links=, =reveal_keyboard=, =reveal_overview=
    - Custom variables:\\
      =org-reveal-control=, =org-reveal-progress=,
      =org-reveal-history=, =org-reveal-center=, =org-reveal-rolling-links=, =org-reveal-keyboard=, =org-reveal-overview=

    For an example, please refer to the heading part of this document.

** Third-Party Plugins
Reveal.js is also extensible through third-party plugins. Org-reveal now includes a mechanism to load these as well. It's a little more complicated, because we need to store the specific javascript loading code in a defcustom.

Store the names and loading instructions for each plugin in the defcustom ~org-reveal-external-plugins~. This defcustom is an associative list. The first element of each Assoc cell is a symbol -- the name of the plugin -- and the second is a string that will be expanded by the ~format~ function when the plugin is loaded. So, this second element should have the form ~" {src: \"%srelative/path/toplugin/from/reveal/root.js\"}'.  If you need the async or callback parameters, include those too.  Ox-reveal will add the plugin to the dependencies parameter when Reveal is initialized.

** Highlight Source Code

   There are two ways to highlight source code.
   1. Use your Emacs theme
   2. Use highlight.js


   To Use your Emacs theme, please make sure ~htmlize.el~ is
   installed. Then no more setup is necessary.

   Below is an example. Codes are copied from [[http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/The_Fibonacci_sequence][Haskell Wiki]].
   #+BEGIN_SRC haskell
   fibs = 0 : 1 : next fibs
       where next (a : t@(b:_)) = (a+b) : next t
   #+END_SRC

   If you saw odd indentation, please set variable =org-html-indent=
   to =nil= and export again.

*** Using highlight.js

    You can also use [[https://highlightjs.org][highlight.js]], by adding ~highlight~ to the Reveal.js
    plugin list.
    #+BEGIN_SRC org
      ,#+REVEAL_PLUGINS: (highlight)
    #+END_SRC

    The default highlighting theme is ~zenburn.css~ brought with
    Reveal.js. To use other themes, please specify the CSS file name by
    ~#+REVEAL_HIGHLIGHT_CSS~ or the variable ~org-reveal-highlight-css~.

    The "%r" in the given CSS file name will be replaced by Reveal.js'
    URL.

** Editable Source Code
It is now possible to embed code blocks in a codemirror instance in order to edit code during a presentation.  At present, this capacity is turned on or off at time export using these defcustoms:
- ~org-reveal-klipsify-src~
- ~org-reveal-klipse-css~
- ~org-reveal-klipse-js~
This feature is turned off by default and needs to be switched on with ~org-reveal-klipsify-src~.  At present code editing is supported in javacript, clojure, php, ruby, scheme, and python only.

** MathJax
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: my-heading
  :END:


   ${n! \over k!(n-k)!} = {n \choose k}$

   LateX equation are rendered in native HTML5 contents.

   *IMPORTANT*: Displaying equations requires internet connection to
   [[http://mathjax.org/][mathjax.org]] or local MathJax installation. For local MathJax
   installation, set option =REVEAL_MATHJAX_URL= to the URL pointing
   to the local MathJax location.

   *Note*: Option ~reveal_mathjax~ is obsolete now. Org-reveal
   exports necessary MathJax configurations when there is Latex
   equation found.

** Preamble and Postamble

   You can define preamble and postamble contents which will not be
   shown as slides, but will be exported into the body part of the
   generated HTML file, at just before and after the slide contents.

   Change preamble and postamble contents globally by setting variable
   =org-reveal-preamble= and =org-reveal-postamble=.

   Change preamble and postamble contents locally by setting options
   =REVEAL_PREAMBLE= and =REVEAL_POSTAMBLE=, as illustrated at the
   heading part of this document.

   To add custom contents into HTML =<head>= parts, set contents to
   variable =org-reveal-head-preamble= or option
   =REVEAL_HEAD_PREAMBLE=.

*** Generating Pre/Postamble by Emacs-Lisp Functions

    If the contents of pre/postamble is the name of an evaluated
    Emacs-Lisp function, which must accept an argument of Org-mode
    info and return a string, the returned string will be taken
    as pre/postamble contents.

    So you can embed the Emacs-Lisp function as an Org-Babel source
    block and mark it to be evaluated when exporting the document.

** Raw HTML in Slides

   Besides the Org contents, you can embed raw HTML contents
   into slides by placing a =#+REVEAL_HTML= keyword.

   The famous cat jump fail:
#+REVEAL_HTML: <iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Awf45u6zrP0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
** Speaker Notes
   Reveal.js supports speaker notes, which are displayed in a separate
   browser window. Pressing 's' on slide's windows will pop up a window
   displaying the current slide, the next slide and the speaker notes on the current
   slide.

   Org-reveal recognize texts between =#+BEGIN_NOTES= and =#+END_NOTES=
   as speaker notes. See the example below.

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,* Heading 1
   Some contents.
,#+BEGIN_NOTES
  Enter speaker notes here.
,#+END_NOTES
#+END_SRC

#+REVEAL: split
   Speaker notes requires the ~notes~ plug-in. If you changed default
   plug-in setting by specifying =#+REVEAL_PLUGINS= or by setting
   variable =org-reveal-plugins=, please make sure ~notes~ is in the
   plug-in list to enable speaker notes.

#+REVEAL: split

   Due to a bug in Reveal.js, sometimes the speaker notes window
   shows only blank screens. A workaround to this issue is to put
   the presentation HTML file into the Reveal.js root directory and
   reopen it in the browser.

*** Easy-Template for Speaker Notes

    Org-reveal registers 'n' as the key for speaker notes easy-template.
    So you can press '<' followed by 'n' and then press TAB, the ~#+BEGIN_NOTES~
    and ~#+END_NOTES~ pair is inserted automatically.

    Customize ~org-reveal-note-key-char~ to change the default key
    'n'. set it to nil will forbid the auto-completion for speaker notes.

** Multiplexing
   Reveal.js supports multiplexing, which allows allows your audience to view
   the slides of the presentation you are controlling on their own phone, tablet
   or laptop. As the master presentation navigates the slides, all client
   presentations will update in real time. See a demo at
   http://revealjs.jit.su/.

   You can enable multiplexing for your slide generation by including the
   following options:
#+BEGIN_SRC org
#+REVEAL_MULTIPLEX_ID: [Obtained from the socket.io server. ]
#+REVEAL_MULTIPLEX_SECRET: [Obtained from socket.io server. Gives the master control of the presentation.]
#+REVEAL_MULTIPLEX_URL: http://revealjs.jit.su:80 [Location of socket.io server]
#+REVEAL_MULTIPLEX_SOCKETIO_URL: http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/socket.io/0.9.10/socket.io.min.js
#+REVEAL_PLUGINS: ([any other plugins you are using] multiplex)
#+END_SRC

   You must generate unique values for the =REVEAL_MULTIPLEX_ID= and
   =REVEAL_MULTIPLEX_SECRET= options, obtaining these from the socket.io server
   you are using.

   If you include these options in your .org file, reveal-org will enable your
   .html file as the master file for multiplexing and will generate a file named
   in the form =[filename]_client.html= in the same directory as the client
   .html file. Provide your audience with a link to the client file to allow
   them to track your presentation on their own device.

** Extra Stylesheets

   Set =REVEAL_EXTRA_CSS= to a stylesheet file path in order to load extra custom
   styles after loading a theme.

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,#+REVEAL_EXTRA_CSS: url-to-custom-stylesheet.css
#+END_SRC

** Select Built-In Scripts

   Set option =REVEAL_PLUGINS= or variable =org-reveal-plugins= to a
   lisp list to select built-in scripts.

   Available built-in scripts are:
   classList/markdown/highlight/zoom/notes/search/remotes.

   Default built-ins are: classList/markdown/highlight/zoom/notes/multiplex.

   The following examples select /markdown/ and /highlight/ only.
#+BEGIN_SRC org
,#+REVEAL_PLUGINS: (markdown highlight)
#+END_SRC

** Extra Dependent Script

   Set =REVEAL_EXTRA_JS= to the url of extra reveal.js dependent
   script if necessary.
#+BEGIN_SRC org
,#+REVEAL_EXTRA_JS: url-to-custom-script.js
#+END_SRC

** Extra Slide Attribute

   Set property =reveal_extra_attr= to headings to add any necessary attributes
   to slides.

** Export into Single File

   By setting option =reveal_single_file= to ~t~, images and necessary
   Reveal.js scripts will be embedded into the exported HTML file, to make
   a portable HTML. Please note that remote images will /not/ be included in the
   single file, so presentations with remote images will still require an Internet
   connection.

   Attention: This needs locally available reveal.js files!

   #+BEGIN_SRC org
   ,#+OPTIONS: reveal_single_file:t
   #+END_SRC

   When exporting into single file, functions provided by Reveal.js
   libraries will be disabled due to limitation, including PDF export,
   Markdown support, zooming, speaker notes and remote control.

   Code highlight by highlight.js is also disabled. But *code
   highlight by Emacs is not effected.*

** Export Current Subtree

  Use menu entry " C-c C-e R S" to export only current subtree,
  without the title slide and the table of content, for a quick preview
  of your current edition.

* COMMENT Tips

** Disable Heading Numbers

   Add =num:nil= to =#+OPTIONS=
#+BEGIN_SRC org
,#+OPTIONS: num:nil
#+END_SRC

** Disable Table of Contents

   Add =toc:nil= to =#+OPTIONS=
#+BEGIN_SRC org
,#+OPTIONS: toc:nil
#+END_SRC

   This is actually an option recognized by =org-export=. It is only mentioned
   here because slide decks often do not need a TOC.

** Internal Links

   Reveal.js supports only jump between slides, but not between
   elements on slides. Thus, we can only link to headlines in an Org
   document.

   You can create links pointing to a headline's text, or its
   custom-id, as the examples below:

   * [[Tips]].
   * [[#my-heading][Heading]] with a =CUSTOM_ID= property.

** Custom JS

   To pass custom JS code to ~Reveal.initialize~, state the code by
   ~#+REVEAL_INIT_SCRIPT~ (multiple statements are concatenated) or by
   custom variable ~org-reveal-init-script~.

** Executable Source Blocks
To allow live execution of code in some languages, enable the klipse plugin by setting ~org-reveal-klipsify-src~ to non-nil.  Src blocks with the languages ~js~, ~clojure~, ~html~, ~python~, ~ruby~, ~scheme~, ~php~ will be executed with output shown in a console-like environment.  See the source code of ~org-reveal-src-block~ for more details.

*** HTML Src Block
#+BEGIN_SRC html
<h1 class="whatever">hello, what's your name</h1>
#+END_SRC

*** Javascript Src Block
#+BEGIN_SRC js
console.log("success");
var x='string using single quote';
x
#+END_SRC

*** Perl Src Block (not klipsified)
#+BEGIN_SRC perl
I don't know perl!
#+END_SRC

Structuring-mechanisms, such as Java's ~package~ and Haskell's ~module~, are often
afterthought secondary citizens whose primary purpose is to act as namespace delimiters,
while relatively more effort is given to their abstraction encapsulation counterparts,
e.g., Java's classes and Haskell's typeclasses.
A /dependently-typed language/ (DTL) is a typed language
where we can write /types/ that depend on /terms/; thereby blurring conventional
distinctions between a variety of concepts.
In contrast, languages with non-dependent type systems tend to distinguish
/external vs.{{{null}}} internal/ structuring-mechanisms ---as in
Java's ~package~ for namespacing vs.{{{null}}} ~class~ for abstraction encapsulation---
with more dedicated attention and power for the internal case ---as it is
expressible within the type theory.

\vspace{1em}

# \parencite{ocaml_website, maude_module_algebra, B_reuse}
To our knowledge, relatively few languages ---such as OCaml, Maude, and the B Method---
allow for the manipulation of
external structuring-mechanisms as they do for internal ones.
Sufficiently expressive type systems, such as those of dependently typed
languages, allow for the internalisation of many concepts
thereby conflating a number of traditional programming notions.
Since DTLs permit types that depend on terms, the types may require
non-trivial term calculation in order to be determined.
Languages without such expressive type systems necessitate certain constraints
on its constructs according to their intended usage.
It is not clear whether such constraints have been brought to more expressive
languages out of necessity or out of convention.
Hence we propose a systematic exploration of the structuring-mechanism
design space for dependently typed languages to understand
/what are the module systems for DTLs?/

\vspace{1em}

First-class structuring-mechanisms have values and types of their own
which need to be subject to manipulation by the user, so it is reasonable
to consider manipulation combinators for them from the beginning.
Such combinators would correspond to the many generic operations that one
naturally wants to perform on structuring-mechanisms
---e.g., combining them, hiding components, renaming components---
some of which, in the external case, are impossible to perform in any DTL
without resorting to third-party tools for pre-processing.
Our aim is to provide a sound footing for systems of structuring-mechanisms
so that structuring-mechanisms become another common feature in dependently typed languages.
An important contribution
of this work will be an implementation, as an extension of the current Agda implementation, of our module combinators
---which we hope to be accepted into a future release of Agda.

If anything, our aim is practical ---to save developers from ad hoc copy-paste
preprocessing hacks.

1. a uniform, and *practical*, syntax for both /records/ (semantics) and /termtypes/ (syntax)
2. on-the-fly unbundling; and,
3. *mechanically* obtain data structures from theories

* Unbundling Problem

** Monoid ---“Untyped Composition”

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- We have things, called src_haskell[:exports code]{Carrier},
- … and we want to ‘combine’ them via some operation src_haskell[:exports code]{_⨾_}
- … which has a ‘do nothing’ value src_haskell[:exports code]{Id}.

** Typeclass approach, as in Haskell
#+begin_src agda2
record MonoidOn (Carrier : Set) : Set where
    field
      _⨾_ : Carrier → Carrier → Carrier
      Id  : Carrier
      leftId : ∀ x → Id ⨾ x ≡ x
      rightId : ∀ x → x ⨾ Id ≡ x
      assoc   : ∀ x y z →   (x ⨾ y) ⨾ z
                            ≡  x ⨾ (y ⨾ z)
#+end_src

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
#+begin_src agda2
open MonoidOn {{...}}
#+end_src

** Examples
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Programs and sequential (or parallel) composition
- *Numbers and addition (or multiplication)*
- Writing words on a page ---i.e., lists and catenation

** What is “the” monoid on the natural numbers?

*** Additive?
#+begin_src agda2

  ℕ₊ : MonoidOn ℕ
  ℕ₊ = record { _⨾_     = _+_
              ; Id      = 0

              ; rightId = +-identityʳ
              ;  assoc  = +-assoc }

ex : ∀ (m n : ℕ) → m ⨾ n  ≡  n ⨾ m
ex = +-comm
#+end_src

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
⇨ src_haskell[:exports code]{__⨾__} is determined to be src_haskell[:exports
code]{_+_}by *instance search* ⇦

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
#+begin_src agda2
likewise : ∀ (m : ℕ) → m ⨾ Id ≡ m
likewise = rightId
#+end_src

*** … or Multiplicative?
#+begin_src agda2
instance
  ℕₓ : MonoidOn ℕ
  ℕₓ = record { _⨾_     = _*_
              ; Id      = 1
              ; leftId  = *-identityˡ
              ; rightId = *-identityʳ
              ; assoc   = *-assoc }
#+end_src

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
#+begin_src agda2
-- whoops : ∀ {m : ℕ} → m ⨾ Id ≡ m
-- whoops = {!!}
#+end_src

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
⇨ ℕ₊ and ℕₓ are both candidates! *No unique solution!* ⇦

*** Haskell's Solution

Make *two isomorphic copies* of numbers …

#+begin_quote
Some types can be viewed as a monoid in more than one way, e.g. both addition
and multiplication on numbers. In such cases we often define newtypes and make
those instances of Monoid, e.g. Sum and Product.
---[[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.0.0/docs/Data-Monoid.html#t:Monoid][Hackage Data.Monoid]]
#+end_quote

#+begin_src haskell
Sum α ≅ α  {- and -} Product α ≅ α
#+end_src
For src_haskell[:exports code]{Num α} they have different monoid instances.

* Unbundling in Agda
** Alternate Solution to Multiple Monoid Instance Problem

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
*Start* with /fully bundled/ src_haskell[:exports code]{Monoid}
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
*then* /expose fields as parameters/ *on the fly*.

** How?

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
*Reflection!*

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Unfortunately, current mechanism cannot touch
  src_agda2[:exports code]{record}-s /directly/.
- But every record is a Σ-type (•̀ᴗ•́)و

** Records as ΠΣ-types

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Instead of the nice /syntactic sugar/
  #+begin_src agda2 :tangle no
record R (ε¹ : τ¹) ⋯ (εʷ : τʷ) : Set _
  where
    field
      εʷ⁺¹ : τʷ⁺¹
      ⋮
      εʷ⁺ᵏ : τʷ⁺ᵏ
#+end_src

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Use a more raw form  ---/eek!/
  #+begin_src agda2 :tangle no
R  ≅  Π ε¹ : τ¹ • ⋯ • Π εʷ : τʷ
      • Σ εʷ⁺¹ : τʷ⁺¹ • ⋯ • Σ εʷ⁺ᵏ : τʷ⁺ᵏ
        • 𝟙
#+end_src

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
⇨ /“R is a ΠʷΣ type”/  ---a *(partitioned) context*
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
⇨ It has *parameters* ~ρ⁰, …, ρʷ~ and *fields* ~ρʷ⁺¹, …, ρʷ⁺ᵏ~
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
⇨ $w$ is the *“waist”*

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
E.g., src_haskell[:exports code]{MonoidOn} is a Π¹Σ type

** Shucks, the Unbundling Problem Strikes Again

If we encode a record as a ΠʷΣ type, what if we want
to /instantiate, fix,/ a field ---instead of a parameter?

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
We thus need a way to *lift parameters to fields*!
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
( Teaser: src_haskell[:exports code]{Π→λ} ! )

** *Pragmatic* Notation for Contexts

Instead of src_agda2[:exports code]{Set}, use src_agda2[:exports code]{(waist :
ℕ) → Set}

#+begin_src agda2 :exports none

** COMMENT A Language Has Many Tongues :unreadable:

1. Expression language; e.g., ~cond ? this : that~.
2. Statement, or control flow, language; e.g., ~if (cond) {this} {that}~.
3. Type language; e.g., ~Functor f => () → f ()~.
4. Specification language; e.g., ~\forall ℤ i; A[i] ≤ \old(A[i])~.
5. Proof language; e.g., ~begin ⋯ ≡⟨ ? ⟩ ⋯ ∎~.
6. Module language; e.g., ~module, class, interface~.
7. Meta-programming languages; e.g., Coq tactics, C preprocessor, Haskell pragmas.

The first five languages telescope down into one uniform language
within the dependently-typed language Agda. *So why not the module language?*

#+BEGIN_NOTES
+ Let's set the stage for what's coming up.

+ Can modules be treated the same way as the others?

+ First question then is what is a module?
#+END_NOTES

** What is a Module?

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   *Definition:* A typed /module, context, telescope, package former, record, typeclass/
   is a sequence of tuples:
{{{begin-center}}}
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
   Name  :  Type  :=  Optional_Definition
#+END_SRC
{{{end-center}}}

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
   Without types, we obtain essentially JSON Objects.
   # Akin to a JSON Object, which is an untyped module.

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   *Purpose:* Group related concepts together as single /semantic/ units.

** Expectations of Module Systems

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
+ Namespacing :: New unique local scopes ⇒ de-coupling

+ Information Hiding :: Inaccessibility ⇒ Implementation independence

+ Citizenship :: Grouping mechanisms should be treated like ordinary values

+ Polymorphism :: Grouping mechanisms should group all kinds of things without prejudice

+ Object-Orientation :: Generative modules & Subtyping
# Object-oriented notions of encapsulation

# Implementation aspect, unrelated to the others. Relocate.
#
# + Sharing :: Module parameter computations shared across constituents.

** What about ⋯

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   😧 :: Coders have to copy-paste-modify packaging structures to obtain
   different perspectives.
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - E.g., lifting fields to parameters to
      ensure correct-by-construction invariants.
   - Infrastructure is either rewritten for the new perspective,
     or conversion functions are used.

   #+BEGIN_NOTES
   Conversely, one may want to demote parameters to fields so as to be
   able to treat a structure heterogeneously.

   E.g., One may speak of “graphs on” a fixed type, but to speak of
   graphs in general, the type cannot be fixed and must be allowed to
   vary. One instance of this is constructing a category of graphs.

Random notes:

+ A canonical structure is a declaration of a particular
  instance of a record to be used by the type checker
  to solve unification problems.

+ OCaml functors are more or less functions on records in Agda.

+ Typeclasses are tremendously helpful for having derived constructions
  be inferrable, e.g., in Haskell ~instance f a => f (a ,a)~ to
  produce Cartesian products for some structure ~f~ on ~a~ provided
  there is such a structure on ~a~.

  One now uses ~f~ methods, that act on a homogeneously-typed pair,
  and it is inferred that an instance of ~f a~ is what is desired
  --even though no explicit instance for such a pair type was declared!
  Neato ^_^

+ Coq's unification is essentially Prolog in disguise.

+ In some sense, I intend to produce Agda package combinators that
  are essentially Lisp in disguise.

+ Solve Diamond Problem using dependent types as follows:
  #+BEGIN_SRC haskell
  record X : Set where field doit : Set
  record Y : Set where field x : X
  record Z : Set where field x : X

  record Ω : Set where filed y : Y, z : Z
  {- We now can refer to two X's, possibly different -}

  {- Instead, using typeclasses -}
  record X         : Set where field doit : Set
  record Y (x : X) : Set where
  record Z (x : X) : Set where

  record Ω : Set where filed x : X, y : Y x, z : Z x
  #+END_SRC

  With dependent types, ~X~ can be lifted to be any telescope of functions
  that cold conflict ^_^

** Why can't this be done now?

| ⇨ | Agda has a tremendously weak reflection mechanism             |
| ⇨ | Package formers need to be introduced into the back-end       |
| ⇨ | Unclear semantics of package formers                          |
| ⇨ | Unclear whether semantics don't break other language features  |

#+BEGIN_NOTES
The language, Agda, currently does not possess the sufficient abstraction
mechanisms to make this endeavour feasible within the core language.

* COMMENT Approach  :ignore:
** Proposed Contributions

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
     1. Module system for DTLs: Modules are ordinary values
    - Enables rather than inhibits efficiency
    - Well-defined denotational semantics

     2. Use-cases contrasting resulting system with previous approaches

     3. Replace metaprogramming processing with module primitives

     4. An implementation to obtain validation that our system ‘works’

** COMMENT Choice of Language

#   *TODO* Look at the good readon why using agda, see proposal.pdf.

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
+ More than ‘research quality’ ⇒ ready for a broad audience
+ Dependent types
+ Existing industrial-strength compiler?
+ Reasoning and proofs?

** Next Steps

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
1. Distill the /true/ requirements for a solution

2. Deepen understanding of the opportunities given by DTL

3. Demonstrate the power of the system

4. Evaluate the mechanisms

   - Additions actually contribute to program design?

5. Ensure a denotational semantics for the mechanisms

6. Refine above until elegance, or deadline, is reached, whichever comes first

** Timeline

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear appear appear)
+ The First Pass: May-October 2019 :: Thorough familiarity with
      approaches, Agda internals, begun thesis writing

+ The Middle Pass: November 2019 - February 2020 ::
   Implement module formation primitives
   from the thesis proposal, while forming & extending
   semantics

+ The Final Pass: March - April 2020 ::
   Implementations meet requirements; mechanise proofs
